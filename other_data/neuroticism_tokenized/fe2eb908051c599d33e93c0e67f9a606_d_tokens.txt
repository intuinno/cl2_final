Gearing up for < PROPFEMALE>'s Birthday Meal :-) 

Looking forward to seeing my parents aftertheir European getaway while getting to spend time at the Stephens House for < PROPFEMALE > Butler's 39th birthday meal :-) 
Hockey's over , now on to baseball : oy ve . 
Sorry Cavs fans , but < PROPMALE > Izzo made the right decision to stay at Michigan State . Name 1 college coach who has successfully transitioned to the pros ( < PROPFIRST > Brown does not count ) . 
Sex and the City 2 : an okay movie NOT worth paying $11.00 to see . 
LaBron has just become Pippen . He could have become < PROPFIRST > . If he doesn't think Miami is < PROPMALE>'s town , he's in for a surprise . Although Stockton and Malone never won , they are still HIGHLY respected . Miller also made the Pacers special ( having been to Indy for the Big 10 Tourn . & the Final 4 , I can see how hard that actually was to do ) . I'm not a big fan of the NBA , and now I'm even less so . 
Tomorrow is \VIVA ESPANA !!!! \ " Today is \ " GO GERMANY !!!! \ " \ 
Today is the 5th birthday of my cute and oh so silly niece , Cayenne Stephens . I look forward to seeing her grow every day and year . 
Out of the office thorugh Tuesday . Mini vacation for me : yippee !! 
If you like Momento , then see Inception . It's one of the better movies I've seen in a long time . Also , it's got a great cast :-) 
Alraedy burned 980 calories this morning and am ready to start the day :-) 
Going to get ready to go see my favorite pumpkins ( CAS times 2 ) in the pumpkin patch . 
For my 2 brothers-in law ( < PROPFIRST > serving in the Air Force and stationed in Hawaii and < PROPMALE > serving in the Navy and stationed in Japan ): thank you for all you do :-) 
Celebrating my sister's birthday tonight , making baked brie with almonds and either pears or apples , and getting some Cayenne time while the boys go cheer for Northwestern to beat Iowa : GO CATS !!! 
I finished < PROPFEMALE > KARENINA !!!!!!!!!!! 
I find myself thinking that I'd like to see South < PROPFEMALE > beat Auburn , thus really messing up the BCS . . . 
R.I.P. < PROPMALE > Santo : your heart always bled Cubbie Blue and always remained true . 
Finished a nice book called Breakfast with Budha yesterday and am starting Breakfast of Champions today . 
Let's hear it for NORTHWESTERN alum < PROPFIRST > Wootton for knocking out < PROPFIRST > Favre !! 
I saw three really good , but quite diverse , movies over the holiday season and can recommend all of them : The Kings Speech , True Grit and The Fighter . 
In the interest of teaching my nephew and niece that you cheer for a team instead of against one , as much as it pains me say this , GO STEELERS ! 
Remember to always judge others \not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . \"" 
Let it snow , let it snow , let it snow ???? SOOOOOO not expected this morning . It should definitely add an interesting twist to the Bears-Packers game today . . . 
Great win by the Cats against the Illini yesterday . All that's left to say this weekend is GO , PACK , GO ! 
Sorry Bears and Steelers fans , but the Pack is tops :-) Let's see what happens next season , if there is a next season . 
New cellphone for me to play with :-) 
I voted today in the Chicago general election :-) 
Nothing like your car not starting to \start\ " your weekend :-) " 
On the way to Indianapolis to cheer on Northwestern , hopefully for more than one day :-) 
Go Cats !! What a reward : Ohio State . While I have family members attending there right now , I'm still with my brother-in-law and the Cats :-) 
Northwestern gave Ohio State a run for their money ;-) 
Ohio State about to be crowned Big Ten Champions :-) 
On this date 10 years ago , I mentioned that I looked forward to see what picture would be made by the pieces of a puzzle put together by the marriage of < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > Stephens ( the foundation being the families ) . 10 years later , I couldn't have imagined the beauty of that picture : from the Cohen/Stephens parents & siblings to the absolute joy that is < PROPMALE > and Cayenne . Happy 10th Anniversary , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Cheering on BUTler ( Cayenne ) tonight and Norte Dame tomorrow :-) 
Have you ever felt like you're channelling < PROPFIRST > Carlin ? Well , this week , that would have been me . 
BEST NEWS ALL DAY : Quinoa is kosher for Passover . YIPPEE !!!! 
Made gazpacho soup for Passover consumption today :-) 
The Passover gift I received last Wednesday ( a head cold ) keeps hanging on . At least I haven't felt the need to share :-)
