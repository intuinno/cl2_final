The Scene Aesthetic <3 Come What May 

Woo ! I just managed to get my new webcam working xDDD I'm sooo happy now 
is not excited for school tomorrow :/ ehh . 
I'm on my way to Minneapolis !! 
Excited for Alaska ! 
I am so excited for fourth of July because i am driving my go-kart in the parade and Rio is riding with me ! =) <3 Rio !! 
Gonna go to bed cause i got summer school tomorrow ... 
That made me think of my favorite band , 3 doors down ! I can't pick a favorite song . 
Im listening to 3 doors down ... bored ... and cleaning the entire house because everyone left and i got stuck at home ... =/ 
Im makin mac'n'cheese 
Right after i go to Alaska , im determined to get my belly button pierced ... if it weren't for metal detectors i'd do it now ! =/ 
Listening to Careless Whisper by Seether ... bored ... 
thinks that sometimes she is a facebook addict and therefore is going to eat some tacos 
WHOA I HAD TOO MUCH SUGAR TONIGHT !!!!! THANKS < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! WHOOOO I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE UP FOR HOURS AND HOURS !!!!!!!!! AHHH !!!!!! JUST WAIT TILL I CRASH =) =) 
Im so overtired its funny =) 
My brother is going to get married ! 
So excited for Alaska ! Im gonna have so many pictures ! I hope ... lol 
I'm leaving to go get my hair cut in a half an hour ! I'm not sure if i want it cut but its getting chopped off either way now =) 
Im working tonight at 5:00 until LATE lol im gonna have tons of fun ! ( not ) 
ugh so bored ... i think i might go to bed now considering i have to get up tomorrow morning , early and play some tennis . 
Listening to Owl City =D 
I've been looking in the mirror for so long , that i've come to believe my soul's on the other side . All the little pieces falling , shatter . Shards of me too sharp to put back together , to small to matter , but big enough to cut me into so many little pieces . If i try and touch her i bleed , i bleed , and i breathe , i breathe no more . 
I officially feel like a jerk ... ugh . Im going to try and get some sleep . 
How can i pretend that i don't see , what you hide so carelessly ? I saw her bleed , you heard me breathe and i froze inside myself , and turned away ... I must be dreaming . We all live , we all die , that does not begin to justify you . It's not what it seems , not what you think , no i must be dreaming . It's only in my mind , not real life , no i must be dreaming . 
Sparkling grey , they're my own veins . Any more than a whisper , any sudden movement of my heart , and I know , I know I'll have to watch them pass away . Just get through this day , give up your way , you could be anything , give up my way , and lose myself , not today . That's too much guilt to pay . Sickened in the sun , you dare tell me you love me , but you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die . 
Once more I'll say goodbye to you , things happen but we don't really know why . If it's supposed to be like this , why do most of us ignore the < PROPMALE > to miss . Torn apart at the seams of my dreams turn to tears I'm not feeling the situation . Run away try to find that safe place you can hide It's the best place to be when you're feeling like , me ! All these things i hate revolve around me . Just back off before i snap . 
Tired from tennis ... ugh ... i think im going to go to bed real soon . 
Evanescence-Lose Control You don't remember my name . I don't really care . Can we play the game your way ? Can I really lose control ? Just once in my life , I think it'd be nice , just to lose control , just once , with all the pretty flowers in the dust . Just once in my life , I think it'd be nice , just to lose control , just once . If I cut you down to a thing I can use , I fear there will be nothing good left of you . 
The first time I wont regret one look into your eyes and I'll never forget . But you're not about to jump right into this tonight . Wondering just what to do , every single second in the room with you . I can't talk this over , to win you over , here tonight . So open your eyes , don't say goodnight , wondering why , alone tonight . I'll just let it go for you . I'm letting you down , you're just hiding it so well . 
What did the egg say to the boiling water ? It'll be a minute before i get hard , i just got laid by a chick ... 
I didn't even remember that school was tomorrow ! Thanks a lot for all those who had to announce that on here ! lol 
School kinda sucked ... its all because i have Chem ... 
Gonna go to bed but not looking forward to Chem ... all the rest of my classes are pretty fun ! 
Still awake working on understanding the first < PROPFEMALE > of 20 that we have to read for poly sci ... 
Stay low . Soft , dark , and dreamless , Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness . I hate me , For breathing without you . I don't want to feel anymore for you . Grieving for you , I'm not grieving for you . Nothing real love can't undo , And though I may have lost my way , All paths lead straight to you . I long to be like you , Lie cold in the ground like you . Halo , Blinding wall between us . Melt away and leave us alone again . 
Downloading a crap-load of Evanescence songs 
* sigh * i don't feel like doing anything today ... and definately not looking forward to school tomorrow . :/ 
Wake up on your own And look around you cuz you're not alone Release your high hopes and they'll survive Cuz this is the future and you are alive Dive in and swim away From your loneliness and miserable days And when you wake up on your own Look around you cuz you're not alone Let your hopes go and they'll survive Cuz this is the future and you are alive You're headed home You're headed home 
Bored out of my mind and don't wanna go to sleep 
I'm going to the Kalahari for this weekend !! xDDDD It's actually a business thing . 
You can’t break me down , I’ve become stronger , and I’ve come to believe in myself . But what if I wanted to break , laugh it all off in your face ? What would you do ? What if I fell to the floor ? Couldn’t take this anymore ? What if I wanted to fight ? For the rest of my life . What would you do ? You say you want me , but what are you waiting for ? I’m not running from you . Nothing seems to change and nothing seems to fit . 
Just got back from the Kalahari ! xD 
Tired of all the people freaking out about Kanye West taking away < PROPFIRST > Swift's ' moment ' thing ... just let it go already !! 
Lalala 
PLASTIC GREEN < PROPFEMALE > NECKLACE FTW 
Listening to Owl Cityyyy xDDDDD 
Can't figure out that Accounting question ... i will figure it out tomorrow hopefully xD 
Tirrrrreeeeeedddddd ... 
Feeling like a certain someone turned their back on a promise ... so i can't sleep . 
Come , break me down Bury me , Bury me I am finished with you Look in my eyes You're killing me , killing me All I wanted was you I tried to be someone else But nothing seemed to change I know now : this is who I really am inside I Finally found myself Fighting for a < PROPMALE > I know now , this is who i really am 
He's a stranger to some And a vision to none He can never get enough , Get enough of the one For a fortune he'd quit But it's hard to admit How it ends and begins On his face is a map of the world From yesterday , it's coming ! From yesterday , the fear ! From yesterday , it calls him But he doesn't want to read the message here 
I think i've become a facebook addict ... thanks < PROPFEMALE > Schoeneck , and Kricket Koehn , lol you guys are the ones who got me started xDDDD ^-------------------------^ ------- I tagged you guys ! =D 
< PROPFIRST > Williams-Bodies God gave me the sunshine , Then showed me my lifeline I was told it was all mine , Then I got laid on a ley line What a day , what a day , And your Jesus really died for me Then Jesus really tried for me UK and entropy , I feel like its **** in’ me Wanna feed off the energy , Love living like a deity What a day , one day , And your Jesus really died for me I guess Jesus really tried for me 
Question for ppl in Chem : What size were those notecards he handed out . I lost mine lol and i have some notecards but i don't know if they are the right size ?? 
The enemy arrives Escape into the night Everybody run now Break into another time This enemy of mine Divinity defines Everybody run now Everybody run Under the burning sun I take a look around Imagine if this all came down I'm waiting for the day to come Come with us to the right Join in the fight Everybody run now Break into another time Unity divides Division will unite Everybody run now Everybody run

I'm so cool , ice cubes are jealous 
Im going to go see a movie tonight 
If anyone wants to go to a movie , lemme know ... im so bored 
Skillet-Monster The secret side of me , I never let you see I keep it caged but I can't control it So stay away from me , the beast is ugly I feel the rage and I just can't hold it It's scratching on the walls , in the closet , in the halls It comes awake and I can't control it Hiding under the bed , in my body , in my head Why won't somebody come and save me from this , make it end ? 
I'm just a step away I'm just a breath away Losing my faith today Falling off the edge today I am just a man Not superhuman I'm not superhuman Someone save me from the hate It's just another war Just another family torn Falling from my faith today Just a step from the edge Just another day in the world we live I need a hero to save me now I need a hero to save my life A hero will save me just in time 
Been listening to Skillet 
I'm in Miami Biatch !! xD Drink all day , play all night , let's get it poppin ' im in Miami biatch ; everybody on smash , hands in the air o . 0 
The walls are moving closer now Can you feel it , can you feel it ? You are not saved until you see the < PROPFEMALE > Set my < PROPFEMALE > on fire now You did it , you did it Smoked out my soul once and for all I'm coming home tonight Can we make it right ? Or twist the dagger in my back You lit the fires in me that I never thought I had Now it's nothing but a memory ...

In the dark with the music on Wishing I was somewhere else Taking all ur anger out on me , somebody help I would rather rot alone Then spend a minute with u I'm gone , I'm gone And u can't stop me from falling apart ' Cause my self-destruction is all ur fault How cud u , how cud u , how cud u hate me ? < PROPFEMALE > all I ever wanted 2 be was u ? How cud u , how cud u , how cud u luv me ? < PROPFEMALE > all u ever gave me were open wounds ? 
Incubus-DigWe all have a weakness But some of ours r easy to identify Look me in the eye And ask for forgiveness We'll make a pact to never speak that word again Yes u r my friend We all have something that digs at us At least we dig eachother So when weakness turns my ego up I know you'll count on the me from yesterday If I turn into another Dig me up from under what is covering The better part of me Sing this song

~ [{Unwritten Law}] ~ I'm seeing red , don't think you'll have to see my face again . Don't have much time for sympathy cause it never happened to me . Your feeling blue now , i think you bit off more than you could chew , and now it's time to make a choice , and all i wanna hear is your voice . So follow the leader down and swallow your pride and drown , when there's no place left to go , maybe that's when you will know . 
Closer 2 closure Take this out of me Take anything u want Cause Ill still breathe , Ill still breathe Fading thinner but still its haunting me Cant find the words 2 say 2 the angels That took u from me 3 words 3 words My oxygens gone I cant sleep , I cant eat I cry out 2 God just 2 hear me Its another day still the same with all my pain Not yet , not yet break me from these visions Not yet , not yet it's 2 soon 4 u

Getting ready to go skating tonight =) 
Perfect by nature , icons of self-indulgence , just what we all need , more lies about a world that never was & never will be . Have u no shame dont u c me , u kno u got everybody fooled . Look here she comes now , bow down & stare in wonder , oh how we <3 you , no flaws with no pretending . But now i kno she never was & never will b . U dont kno how u've betrayed me & somehow u've got everybody fooled . 
Can u look inside & 4get , never hold ur breath & regret , no more part of this nightmare im awake , but cant leave them behind . Can u b aware & still blind , notice it all but none of ur lies , but the truth will never surrender , always right behind ur back & waiting . U wake up 2 the sound of silent screams , even tho u were asleep 4 1000 yrs , the < PROPFEMALE > of misery inside urself is , burned 2 the ground , burned 2 the ground 
Well , I don't want to see you waiting I've already gone too far away I still can't keep the day from ending No more messed up reasons for me to stay Well , this is not for real , afraid to feel I just hit the floor , don't ask for more I'm wasting my time , I'm wasting my time You can't stop the feeling , there is no reason Let's make the call and take it all again , woah again 
Take My Hand-The Perfect Measure I know that song makes you think of him . And it tears me to know that you still might go back again . Please hear me calling you . I want you to know that it's true , I can't live without you . So take my hand , may I have this last dance . Cuz it's raining outside and we don't live forever , So take my hand . ~ I <3 this song ~ 
Did it hurt ? ... when you fell from heaven ?

I think you've just about lost , your sense of self , your foundations are crumbling down . Don't be the one to say you know what's right . Don't be the one to say you know my heart .

In the middle of September we'd still play out in the rain . Nothing to lose but everything to gain . Reflecting now on how things could've been , it was worth it in the end <3 
\I only trust one person on this planet .. and you're talking to her \"" 
Looking back at me I see\ 
That I never really got it right\ 
I never stopped to think of you\ 
I'm always wrapped up in\ 
Things I cannnot win\ 
You are the antidote that gets me by\ 
Something strong\ 
Like a drug that gets me high\

( Thank you Teddi for getting me addicted :P ) 
I lose myself in all these fights , i lose my sense of wrong and right , i cry , i cry . It's shaking from the pain that's in my head , i just wanna crawl into my bed and throw away the life i led , but i won't let it die . <3 secondhand serenade <3

This world can turn me down , but i won't turn away . I won't duck and run , cuz i'm not built that way . 
The truth is , you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath , i'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt =] 
Where i'm going and where i'll end up , is anybody's guess . 
I just can't get you off my mind , and why would i even try ? 
\I live my life a quarter mile at a time .. nothing else matters . For those 10 seconds or less ; im free \""
