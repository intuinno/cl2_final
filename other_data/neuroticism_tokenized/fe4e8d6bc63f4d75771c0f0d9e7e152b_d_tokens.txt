is really bored . And is tired of being harassed to do crap on this site . I'm only here for friends who don't have an account on myspace . >:p You know who you are . Yeah , you . 

Just for anyone who bothers to listen ... the Friend FAQ thingy was sent to me , and I gave it a try . I was answering the little questions and it sent me to one of those sites that claims your computer is infected , and to download the antivirus software to 
I originally joined this site because most of my friends were on here . I would friend them , chat when I felt like it , and leave my Facebook activity at that . Then the suggestions to add friends , to join groups , and do other stuff from both my jerk friends and the site came along . My will has been broken . I'm just going to add everyone Facebook says I should be buds with , and become a fan of everything under the sun . 
The orientation confused me ... but it was fun . :) 
I find these updates rather pointless , and yet even I come out of my cave and post . I think only one or two people even get my status updates anyway ... 
My family is finding me on facebook .... not even the internet is safe anymore .... :) 
In the cast . I won't have a knee brace until at least tomorrow , so I can't move around very much . 
Gonna volunteer for Secret < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . Hope I can be of help even though I'm on crutches . :) 
Well , I'm out of my cast . Tomorrow I'm getting a hard sole shoe , and going to physical therapy . Not what you'd call fun , but I'll be able to walk . 
Ugh . I don't know if I should keep studying for English . D: Anyone who's taken the test , how hard is it ? 
>:( Blah . 
Ugh . I don't understand commands . :( Ms. Hill is trying to kill me . 
Bacon club . When/Where is it ? Oh , and awesome free music here : http://www.sean-fournier.com/ohmy/ But seriously , I want to experience the microwaved bacon goodness . D: Please tell me . 
It's finally over ... I can finally move freely about my house ... ... Super Bowl sucks . 
I just realized- why do I bother updating my status ? 
Nothing better than a SAD party to make you feel less pathetic . :/ 
PASSENGER . Anyone like them ? 
OH GOD . I was told to Google blue waffle and I was actually retarded enough to do it . D: 
I'm debating about actually sticking a picture of my ugly mug up here . Thoughts ?

I took an IQ test and the results were negative . 
Boredom ...... brought to you by Kellog's Fruit Loops ! :/ What's wrong with me ? 
I just became a fan of strobe lights and epilepsy . Ahaha .... yeah , I feel bad now . 
There are times when you just feel bad , and you try to cover it up . That is not the case right now . 
Who else put their homework off until just now ? :D 
Poking people gets really competitive ... ( I'm talking to you , < PROPFEMALE >...) 
Blah . 
Hey , do we have a test or anything due in Spanish tomorrow ? If anyone that actually sees my status even has Hill ? 
BNL is awesome . 
Hooray . I have absolutely nothing to do .

I loved camping , but there's sand coating everything I brought . :/ 
Happy Easter to all who celebrate it . 
I hate having nothing to do , but not wanting to sleep when it's a school night . 
Thanks to all who wished me a happy birthday . :) I appreciate you , and am getting too lazy to post that individually . 
Best . Night . Ever . I won a camera and a netbook . :) Happy birthday to me . 
Blargh . :(

Sometimes it's nice to just listen to the wind howling outside . 
While running out the door to get to the Springs Preserve , I noticed my dad's car was missing . When I told my mom , the first thing she said was , \Why steal a Hyundai ? \"" 
Sometimes I wonder how many small actions I have done that inadvertently made or ruined someone else's day . 
I have a love-hate relationship with naps . I think I need help . 
Crrrrap . Blackboard isn't working . Anyone know what to study for Street Law ? 
I give up on studying . Anyone else ready to fail ? 
I'm going to stay up all night , and then sleep the daylight hours away . Why ? BECAUSE I CAN .

Boredom is a horrible thing . 
Welcome back , Futurama . Welcome back . :) 
I spoke to a Romanian about his country's politics and then about communism . Currently , I'm talking to a Spaniard about the Cold War . Omegle is growing on me . 
I just had to assist in creating a horribly ghetto shade cover . I am not proud .

Hello there , my dearest stalkers . How are you on this lovely evening ? 
Stop , drop and troll . 
RIP < PROPMALE > Guinn . :/ 
Today is MLIA Status Day , and I wanted to participate . MLIA . 
I looked up my birthday today . When I found I share my birthday with < PROPMALE > Hefner , my day was made . When I found out I also share it with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , my day was ruined . 
-ahem- HELLO . That is all . 
My brain hurts after three days of conference . Worth it ? Of course . 
Just learned her cat can climb ladders ... :| 
Braaaaaaaaaaaaaiiinnsssssss ... 
A children's album by the Barenaked Ladies exists somewhere other than my dreams . I must own it . 
I need someone to share a locker with this year . I plan to make mine into a stereotypical break room , complete with a working water cooler and motivational posters . 
Yes , I lie and I wrangle with prospective angels that glare me down and face me with all I do wrong . Why do they all look like me ? 
Ah , Cleverbot . I convinced it that I'm Big Foot , and that we're married with eight kids . 
Haircut . Fffffff . 
Looking forward to ( hopefully ) seeing the Shat tomorrow . :) 
Thunderstorms <3 
Anyone else think ( Inception spoiler- look away ) that he was still in a dream ? 
I love a good Roast . :) 
My mom used to complain and call me pathetic for not having a large social life . Now that I'm starting to , she complains about how much she has to drive me around . :/ 
Gonna see Weird < PROPMALE > . :DDD 
I never knew what it was like to have my hair molested until today . 
Happy birthday , < PROPMALE > Cardoza . Also , your hair looks funny . :D 
I never realized how much I hate chart notes until now . Such small writing space , so many notes ... 
Apparently , the Celtic Pagan creation story has been lost due to the Christian overtaking all those years ago . :/ What now ? 
Dislocated my knee again ... 
BOW DOWN TO THE HAIR . 
There are few things that can bring a nation together . From liberals to conservatives . From the young to the old . It seems national disasters is one of those things . So , let’s come together as a country as we remember the events that occurred on this day nine years ago . 
found out she needs to make friends with the neighbor boy that dresses in a cloak and uses a sword in his front lawn . 
is so partied out right now . 
For Norby , it's pages 30-35 right ? 
Anyone else get the confirmation email for Quia ? 
TGIF . Seriously . 
I don't understand why people have such an aversion to the ( not ) Ground Zero Mosque . It's their right as American citizens to build it on property they legally own . It's two blocks away , and it's horrible that we have such discrimination in this country because of religious extremists . ( Sorry for the rant , but I'm sick of those of you that assume I share your prejudice . I don't . ) 
I am so getting a hedgehog when I move out . They're AWESOME . 
... would it be bad that I want to join an organized religion just for more scholarship opportunities ? 
My < PROPMALE > & Link Shoes came . :) 
Anyone worried about Oday's test ? Because the her little spiel was not encouraging . 
Just a question : Are people up now because they're doing homework , or just goofing around ? 
Still hasn't started the Norby essay , and really not wanting to have to write a full essay ... :/ 
My parents took great joy in finding out when really embarrassed , I apparently turn pink everywhere . 
Oh sleep , how I love thee . :) 
I just noticed that in the Witch and the Wardrobe , most of the dwarves are Asian . 
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas , I need to get myself away from this place . I said yep , what a concept . I could use a little fuel myself , and we could all use a little change . 
So ... what are we supposed to do with the readability statistics in Norby ? 
Just going to say this in advance : Thank God for naps . 
I'm so lost as far as the essay is concerned . I'm tempted to just BS it and finish my other homework . Any tips for making it sound like I know what I'm talking about ? 
Anyone else going to the college prep thingy ? 
Why is the class that's supposed to supplement what we learn in AP history the harder one ? 
What length did you put for your Last Word ? I'm debating whether to go past 500 words ... 
Did we just need to read the few pages on the rig < PROPFEMALE > , or was there more ? 
So , what did I miss in Norby today ? Mainly , what was the homework ? 
If it weren't for facebook , I would feel a lot worse about doing homework this late . Thanks to it , I know I'm not alone . :) 
Chocolate covered coffee beans <3 . 
I really hate chart notes , but I'm sure I'll love them once we start < PROPMALE > ...

What's on your mind ? I'm really debating whether I want to stay up to finish my history notes or turn them in late tomorrow ... ugh . 
Anyone know clever gift ideas for someone's 18th birthday ? 
People I have classes with : Let me know what I missed ? 
I just took the time to take pictures of the last 4 pages of the history chapter and print them out so I can finish the notes tomorrow . I wonder if I would have finished in that same amount of time . 
My hair is a respectably molestable height again . :) And as far as Norby goes , was there anything due tomorrow ? 
So ... no Norby homework , yes ? 
Searching for some good alternative and techno music . Any suggestions ?

< PROPFEMALE > Chiu , meet Ismenia < PROPFEMALE > . My job here is done . 
Do we need to have the next Wordskills tomorrow ? 
Throw on some nylon pants and bust a Hammer dance ; I’m kicking moves to “You Can’t Touch This” . Tucked in my corduroys , I’ve got my Beastie Boys tape fighting for my right to party though I’m not invited . 
Quia crashed on me when I tried to take the quiz . >:| Now I have to go take it on Monday . 
I just ate a Hershey Kiss that tasted like soap . I'm really confused . 
Any College people nice enough to \assist\ " me with the book work ? " 
Are Word Skills due today or tomorrow ? 
Eh , I'm bored . GO GO GO :\ 
I'm going to be completely honest for the next24 hrs . Ask me anything but only ONE question ( only in my inbox ) . I dare you to post this and see what you get asked ! 
I should start Wordskills . \

I'm so tired of my parents treating me like I'm a waste of space . Last I checked , I go to school , get pretty good grades , don't smoke , drink , or do drugs . And they want to bi+ch me out for taking a nap ? Bullshi+ . 
I'm really confused as to why a church would have an emergency defibrillator . Does too much Jesus cause cardiac arrest ? 
I love how my father tells me to save up for things I would like to have , and then refuses to let me buy said items for reasons he refuses to discuss . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the best person to host a show about quantum physics . Hands down . 
I still believe you were born to take the lead . Come on let's save the world , let's save the world . Yeah , you and me , we've got our promises to keep . 
So ... what did I miss in History and Chemistry ( with Colledge) ? 
I almost made a few kids on the bus cry . Today was a good day . 
Why didn't I choose a better NHD topic . Ugh . 
FINALY DONE . THANK GOD . 
I would say I hate a love-hate relationship with Hist/Lit , but I think I'm just generally discontent at this point . Am I the only one ? 
There's going to be another Pirates of the Caribbean . \ 
... WHY ? 
I didn't have time to do my Norby essay until right now , and I refuse to do it . I can live without one assignment . I'm just ... done . 
I've missed you , dearest sleep . We shan't part this winter break , this I swear . 
My new phone is so shiny . :) 
Postmortem photography is really ... interesting . 
Hopelessly , I feel like there might be something that I'll miss . Hopelessly , I feel like the window closes oh so quick . Hopelessly , I'm taking a mental picture of you now . ' Cuz hopelessly , the hope is we have so much to feel good about .

Hope everyone enjoys this pseudo-religious holiday . :) 
I have decided Daft Punk makes my \I would give my left nut to see in concert\ " list . " 
Why is it that the movies relating to teenage guys losing their virginity tend to be feel good and victorious , while movies about teen girls giving it up basically call the girl a $lut who ends up ashamed of her actions ? 
My father was obviously excited to buy a game when he offered to pay half and find a store with it in stock . This would be fine if it were COD or something , but no . It was Epic < PROPFIRST > . 
Yay all-nighters . 
Ffff . I'll study for chem during the day . Night FB . 
Finally watching Hetalia World Series . ( Japan needs just just get with Greece already , jeeze . ) 
I'm sick . Yay . :/

So , who wants to tell me what I missed today ? 
I hate exams . WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THEM . 
F^CK THIS . -flips table and leaves- 
One ... more ... day ... 
It might be boring , so boring ; it might put you to sleep . The same old routine repeats week after week . And you work harder , work harder ' cuz you’re told that you must , and you must earn a living , and you must earn a crust like everybody else . Just be like everybody else . Be like everybody else .

I AM A HORRIBLE PERSON . 
It would be interesting to get everyone who used to go to Hyde Park together ... if only . 
You know your bus is awesome when you have ridiculous conversations that the bus driver not only tolerates but actively participates in . 
My hands are black from writing in chalk . Worth it ? Definitely . 
I can't decide whether to sleep now and screw Norby's homework , or try to BS it while barely awake . :/ 
I've realized I judge whether buy things ( jewelry , doodads , etc ) by how quirky they are . Not sure that's a good thing ... 
Those that find it sad more people go to a BGM than a dance have obviously never attended one . 
I've realized my mother and I both cheer on our new fridge when it dispenses water and/or ice .

I'm having a hard time justifying the space I take up . I feel pretty worthless . Thanks for the pep talk Dad . It did wonders . :/ 
There was a day that Russia ran out of vodka . My mind has been blown .

I'm going to miss naptim- I mean , driver's < PROPMALE > . 
I thought only smiles would do . Now I see I need the tears and frowns too . Slowly drenched in drizzle ; no rubber boots , no parasol . It's not a roller coaster without the rise and fall . 
I think rock and roll is really funny when it's serious . 
I have a new favorite band : Incubus .
