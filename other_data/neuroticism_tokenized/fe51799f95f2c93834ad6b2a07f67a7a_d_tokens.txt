Just one of those days when you can't put feelings into words when you really want to express something to someone . 
Ahh , Im having so much fun 
Ok , my question now ... : P What's better , Someone with a sense of humor or someone with intellect ? 
I'm talking to a smart person . : 3 
Man , I haven't had so much fun playing bass in a while . Today was a good brainstorming day for ideas . 
* sigh * I have cleaning to do . : ( 
day ... ruined .... : ( 
Well My day has been ruined , Wonder if I'd been better not knowing . This is the biggest bummer of all time . : ( 
I just caught 4 opposums !! They are sooooo cute . I'm having a crappy ass day . 
PROCRASTINATION IS LIKE MASTURBATION , AT FIRST IT FEELS GOOD BUT IN THE END , YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE JUST SCREWING YOURSELF !!! 
GINNAE IS ON A MASS HOMOCIDE MISSION , 9 DOWN -- MANY MORE TO GO ! Or I guess it would be more of an arachnicide mission . I am fully armored with a half-gallon of spider spray ! I don't like spiders , they make me twitch uncontrollably . But , I have a valid reason to be scared since I almost lost a leg to one . 
I'm not sure what to put here today 
( insert news feed here ) 
gah ! I really don't feel like going to school today . Oh well . Guess I'm going even though I feel like my back is splitting in half and I feel like throwing up . Guess I'll feel better when band starts . Band always makes me happy ! : ) 
reat Jazz concert last night !!! Now off to school . ugh .. I have to put the upright back together . * sigh *

R.I.P. Granny 
Man will we ever get a minute to ourselves ?!?!? 
Im a computer nerd today ! Gonna be learning some programming and crap like that all day . 
I have had the most indescribable night learning how to use the 6th sense and see energy in colors and using it for healing purposes ! Now I'm sure a good 90% of you think I'm nutz now , but w/e , my agonizing back pain mystically disappeared anyway : ) 
Im just sad and upset : ( 
Worst day ever , period . 
I like it on the couch 
Hoping for a good day and audition at the high point jazz youth orchestra . 
Moving on now because I'm done . 
First I do what I never think I would do until circumstances are met , and now I am what I truly regret . 
Haha I was searched for drugs at school Thursday because the dog thought it smelled something in my bag ( and apparently my friends ' bags too lol ) . And guess what they found , NOTHING ! because there wasn't anything to find ... stupid dogs ... : P 
Yay , Today's a Great Day ! I'm such a lucky peoples lol . 
Eventually life's puzzle pieces get put into their places , even if they have been put in the wrong places before and stomped on until it fit tighter . 
* sigh * How come that everytime I do something , the next day I wish I had done something different : P 
Someone definitely needs to check out the REAL Carnifex !!!! ( the estonian one ) 
Man , I hate homecoming ... we march around the streets with heavy instruments and get pinches on my arm from the cymbals and everyones screaming but , why even bother if we know we're going to loose ?

Most awesomnest night ever : ) <3 
Had the best time ever jamming in the middle of the gym floor at central during district auditions with complete strangers !!!!! HECK YEA !! 
The best news all day was that I made 1st chair string bass for the all-district 11-12 band . The bad news was that the throttle on my moped got stuck in the go position and I freaked out . Thank God for the Kill-switch !
