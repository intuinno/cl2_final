You can do this night after night . Failure leaves such a bitter taster in my mouth . Taste and see , I swear I know what’s good . Be still and know that they won’t lie to you every single time . 
watch out facebook . here comes like 2 million pictures from last night , from ALL of us . and yes , last night was amazing . 
when trying to kill time facebook does NOT do the job ! 
Have no fear for giving in . Have no fear for giving over . You'd better know that in the end , its better to say too much , then never say what you need to say again . 
I LOVE < PROPFIRST > Armel AND < PROPFEMALE > Krongard 
CANNOT WAIT FOR THURSDAY AND SUNDAY . uhhhhh !!! volleyball ! :] 
cant wait to see me girls on the court :D 
we went in for the kill , came out with the win . this is what team is about . 
And , there you stood holding me , waiting for me to notice you . But who are you ? You are the truth , out screaming these lies . You are the truth , saving my life . 
They did'nt love thier lives enough , as to shirnk from death . Inspired by thier footsteps , we will march ahead . Dont be shocked that people die , be suprised your still alive . 
Tonight I’ve become the most dazzling precious ; I am treasured over all the earth . Just look at what he’s done . How he’s laying down his life , take this life oh most dazzling precious treasure . - Flyleaf ( Treasure ) 
volleyball tourney today !!!! wish us luck ! :D 
Sorrow lasts through this night , I'll take this piece of you and hope for all eternity . For just one second I felt whole , as you flew right through me . 
volleyball :] 
They were wrong : I am the team ; I become the team ; the team became me . The team becomes an entity unto itself . The team is strong , creative , compassionate , caring , authoritative , disciplined . The team absorbs \I\ " and then there is an \ " I\ " in team . The \ " I\ " becomes part of something much more powerful . They were right : there is no \ " I\ " in team . But there is a \ " team\ " in \ " me . \"" 
Biology , oh Biology , why do i have to try so hard to understand you ? 
The only one who's ever known who I am , who I'm not , who I wanna be .

LORD , make this gunuine ; make this concrete . \ 
- < PROPFEMALE >

One day I want to copy someones status word for word and see if they notice . 
running from you is what my best defense is ... 
Opinions are immunity to being told you're wrong . Paper , rock , and scissors , they all have their pros and cons . And all of us we will endure just like we always have . But you just can't be too sure how long this will last . \ 
' Cause we control the chaos in the back of our minds , our problems seem so small ; but they grow on us like gravity . But gravity still makes us fall ... 
Pray for < PROPFEMALE > Z ! Shes in the hospital until friday at the earliest . 
Rockin the oldies :) 
Wow . I left my house an hour ago wearing two different shoes and I just noticed . 
The thing about perfection is that its unseeable , untouchable . But yet its right in front of us everyday . 
Is it such a bad thing that my favorite artist right now is Bille Holiday ? 
Dear Facebook , my Grandpa ( Bernies dad ) took a spill on his bicycle a couple days ago , turns out he fractured his hip . Heres the thing , hes 86 years old and fracturing your hip that old is a big deal . Prayers would be greatly appreciated !!! Thanks Church body !

Feels good to get my work done :) off to see Mr. < PROPMALE > Evans :) 
Had a good time tonight with her dear brother , < PROPMALE > Wollenbreg :) 
Everyday I'm in need of God's grace . On my worst day I'm never so far gone that I'm beyond the reach of God's grace and on my best day I'm never so far beyond the need of God's grace . 
Laa , i need my books ! :/ 
My dog is the best dog in the world . She will listen to me talk to her in the weirdest voice ever and like it . 
What to do on a friday ... 
Consequence , it's our need in times like these . \ 
Feeling free ... it's our modern disease . \ 
Your a classic disaster , with a\ 
Knack for losing your exterior . \ 
( I'm so sick ) ... from staring at the mirror . \ 
<3 underoath 
Wearing the shoes that made me wat slip ons :)

Where does my help come from ? \ 
My help comes from the LORD , \ 
the Maker of heaven and earth . \ 
He will not let your foot slip -\ 
He who watches over you will not slumber . 
I am no longer my own , but yours ... let me be full , let me be empty , let me have all things , let me have nothing . <3 
Chili tonight :) 
Change . 
< PROPFEMALE > , im thinking . If you are praying for Bean(which you SO should ! ) , like this , then we can count and tell her how many people are praying for her ....... comments can count as a message to her :D 
I wish babies could talk . :/ 
< PROPFIRST > Ongstad is a goob . 
ACT , great . :/\ 
maybe it will be better because Gabby will be there ... 
And I will praise You in the storm . Because You are who You are , no matter where I stand . 
And this life sentence i've been serving , I admit im every bit deserving , but the beauty of grace is that it makes life unfair . 
It feels like spring ! 
' cause im a wishful thinker with the worst intentions . 
And this life sentence I've been serving , I admit I'm every bit deserving , but the beauty of grace is that it makes life unfair . 
The sunrise is so beautiful today . Whoo !!! 
Goal of the day : to make it better than yesterday . 
Dadada- Weekend !! 
Disappointment . 
Please , please , please snow tonight !!! 
Whoa . White out . 
SNOW SNOW SNOW ! 
Whooo . No hatch ! ;D 
God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself , because it is not there . There is no such thing . ~ C.S. < PROPFIRST > 
By day the LORD directs His love , at night His song is with me- a prayer to the God of my life . Psalm 42:8 :)

So .... gabbys kinda a dork . But I love her !

Had a great week with her brother ! 
Wow . Talk about teachers on main street ... 
So .... I don't like pop thrown on my car , mostly because car washes are expensive , but also because I don't like my car messed with ..... 
And this life sentence that I’m serving , \ 
I admit that I’m every bit deserving , \ 
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair . \ 
Cause I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity and\ 
I’ve been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key\ 
I gotta get outta here- And I’m begging You , I’m begging You , I’m begging You to be my escape . 
I love my friends :) perkins is sweet ! 
Gahhhh . Hatch :(

Today is Sunday and Monday comes after that . 
Dahhh . I love the iPad !!!!! <3 
I've been dancing on the tops of buildings . \ 
At the top of my lungs I'm singing You a song . 
and im off to clean the kitchen . SO im thinking , mom should put off college until im out of the house .... Just Kidding . Go Mom(Lynne Wollenberg) ! and wright a paper for me to ..... 
One feather light whispering passed from Your lips to my forehead . \ 
Jesus , the feel of ? You in the perfect of that moment - I let go into Oneness . \ 
Around this < PROPFEMALE > I pray . \ 
In the morning the Man , my Best Friend , my One True Love would still be here . \ 
Awake , day breaks not , it is my heart burning for You . \ 
You gave this gift and have allowed me to remember . 
Is anyone elses internet not working ? 
He is jealous for me . He loves like a hurricane , I am a tree , bending beneath His wind and mercy .... 
So about boxelder bugs .... 
Great evening with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > :)
