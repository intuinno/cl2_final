turned her store into the heinous bitch club . Got all of 7 items done on her work list out of 15 . Oh and Gennifer Ozturk forgot to lock the beer coolers so I had to take no less than 5 beers away from people trying to buy after hours . BTW store cutoff time is 3am NOT 4 ( or 5 or 6 . ) Happy fucking new year ... 

went from working one 10-hr and 3 8-hr shifts ( on scheduel ) to 2 10-hr , one 8-hr and possibly an 11 or 12-hr shift . Through no fault of her own . Bossman better remember this come year-review/raise time . If I get told I'm not \flexible\ " enough I'm gonna shove the paperwork down his throat . " 
HAS NO INTERNET ! Until I do , just stop trying to get a hold of me here and use my phone please ! 
finally has internet again !! 
But I can't help it if I'm helpless everytime that I'm with you , oh . 
is putting her feet up to watch some TV before bed . And getting up again to waste another Saturday at work . 
should be leaving for work . Is , instead , checking emails . 
TGIF . Or what passes for my Friday ... 
has the headache from hell . =[ But also has a boy sleeping in her bed . =] And a misbehaving cat . =[ 
So give me reason to prove me wrong and wash this memory clean ...

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls . 
You can see a million < PROPMALE > tonight , but you can't get very far .

Lafou I'm afraid I've been thinking ... 
has a very bad country song stuck in her head . Someone please get it out . 
is apparently not allowed to go back to sleep after only 5 hours of rest . Thank the lord it's only an 8 hour shift tonight . 
thinks this last Questionable Content was hilariously awesome . 
' s body apparently thinks that 6 1/2 hrs of sleep is perfect for an upcoming 11 hr shift . Oh well ... 
survived the 11 hr shift with 3 hrs of surprise training ( another person ) included ! 
is reading a biography of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > before running to catch a bus for work . Hoping < PROPFIRST > won't get the urge to kill me and/or someone else . 
is alive . < PROPFIRST > was in a good mood last night . However , lost her house keys on the bus . FML . Her downstairs neighbor is amazing . 
sex . 
and while everyone else is going to bed , I'm just getting up ... 
says drat that software has to update . All I wanted to do was put a song onto my Zune . 
has a cat by her computer . 
R.I.P. NPC 
My computer just took a crap on me and lost all the YouTube stuff I was trying to do . GRRR . 
knows in time we'll find this was no surprise . 
Mmm < PROPFIRST>'s Late Night .... 
is developing an unhealthy obsession with Strify . 
loves CB and it is inspiring her to write more of her band fiction . 
longs for something mystical , hysterical , dark and tantric sexual ... 
feels like she's coming down with something . Hopes it's allergies . Needs bed for work , but addicted to music . 
is definitely sick . Cinema Bizarre is keeping her company . 
I wanna see how lucky lucky can be . I wanna ride with my angel and live shockingly . I wanna drive to the edge and into the sea . I wanna see how lucky lucky can be . 
Movies or TV ? 
Thou shalt not watch bad movies ! The power of Foamy compells you ! 
Fucking Mormons ! 
Fuck . My . Life . Why can't < PROPFEMALE > go rag on the one who needs it ? My sin wasn't that big . Stupid shitty day at work . Stupid shitty work . Stupid , stupid , stupid . 
Dear God : Just let it go smoothly . You fucked with me enough last night and if this is worse I will have a hissy fit . Love , me . 
Home at last , home at last . Thank God Almighty I am home at last ! 
And shepherds we shall be . For thee , my Lord , for thee . Power hath decended forth from thy hand , that our feet may swiftly < PROPFEMALE > out thy command . So we shall flow a river forth to thee , and teeming with souls shall it ever be . In nomine Patris , et Filil , et Spiritus Sancti . 
We're sort of like 7-11 . We're not always doing business , but we're always open . 
Sometimes there are no words , no clever quotes to sum up what's happened that day . Sometimes , the day just ... * gunshot * ends . 
is playing under the table and dreaming . Take these chances . Place them in a box until a quieter time . Lights down you up and die . 
\Justice without force is powerless . Force without justice is tyrannical . \ " Blaise Pascal . " 
... Stupid Firefox ... 
How do you measure , measure a year ? 
Late for work . Waiting for the cab . Ugh great start to my day ... 
Hmm ... 
is screaming obscenities at her computer . 
just bought her Fall Ball tickets . =] 
\So go on and scream . Scream at me . I'm so far away . I won't be broken again . I've got to breathe I can't keep going under ... \"" 
just finished watching \The Poughkeepsie Tapes\ " and is singing Defying Gravity with her friends via status message . Life is good . " 
What is the best Love Song ever written ? 
So , if anyone is interested in going to Friday's , I will be at the Boulevard Mall roundabout 11-ish ( hopefully . ) Bring your own money , company is free . 
said shut up and put your money where your mouth is . That's what you get for waking up in Vegas ... 
Don't score , just suck . 
is sick . And couldn't call off because no one could take the shift without jumping through hoops . Then got stuck working ' til 10 unexpectedly with no voice because her relief called off . FML hardcore . 
is very disappointed she has not gotten to see her boy like promised . So now I'm up when I could've just stayed in bed . Hoping a good deal of webcomics will alleviate the mood . 
Hypnotized by < PROPFEMALE > . Crawled her way into my head . < PROPFEMALE > of the internet . Caught inside her web . I'll never be the same , she controls me as I sleep . Mindless robot in the street . All my money's hers to keep . Hypnotized by < PROPFEMALE > . 
What is the most depressing song you know ? 
Say you will , say you won't . Say you'll do what I don't . Say you're true , say to me ( wanna say ) C'est La Vie ! 
4 words : Gaia Online Halloween Event . 
just spent most of her day on the phone with someone she hasn't even met in person . YaY for connecting across distances ! 
So count your every mortal day , for you may be put to lay . And all too soon you may be dead , in the grave maggots eating at your head . But you may find you may awake . Surrounded by blood , a pool a lake . Condemned to live and prowl the night . Taking souls , you're only fear is the light . And in that darkness , madness shall come . And from your empty eyes despair shall < PROPFEMALE > from . 
Fighting evil by moonlight . Winning love by daylight . Never running from a real fight . She is the one named Sailor < PROPFEMALE > ! 
That's it's you . My new religion is you . They say this love is blasphemy , it is blasphemy . But my new religion is you . 
loves New Found < PROPFEMALE>'s newest album . Also , thinks Blue October are made of awesome and misses Ellegarden as a band . 
is watching her cat run around the house blindly looking for the tuna my sister is eating . He can smell it but he hasn't thought of checking in her lap yet . 
feels better now . ^_^ Off to bed ! 
Make us . This city's contagious . Caught inside it's pages . We are leaving it all . Hate us . It'll only save us . Stronger than we came up . We are leaving it all ... 
Anybody who likes The Rasmus , Nightwish or both should check on YouTube for the video for \October & April . \ " It's the Rasmus ft . < PROPFEMALE > Olzon ( the new singer for Nightwish . ) " 
I'm on your team . It's us against them you'll see . Hey , hey , hey it ain't gonna stop . They just want what we got . 
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth . How'd I turn my shirt inside out ? Control your poison babe , roses have thorns they say . And we're all getting hosed tonight . 
just worked a shift she didn't actually have to . Her boss better be glad she showed up that day and didn't check her schedual on Monday like she was gonna . 
Fall Ball ! 
is still deaf in one ear and is up way too early for this double . 
JUST got home from her 16 hr shift . That ended at 7 . Thankfully did not kill anyone , but now loathes weekend busses with a passion surpassing that of her loathing of Twilight . Blaming the evil . 
Let me be the one you call . If you jump , I'll break your fall . Lift you up and fly away with you into the night . If you need to fall apart , I can mend a broken heart . If you need to crash then crash and burn , you're not alone . 
We go deep and we don't get no sleep cuz we be up all night until the early light . 
Quote of the Day : \Silent but deadly\ " is a mute velociraptor . " 
The new < PROPMALE > and the Chipmunks movie coming out next month needs to go die . 
I'm late , I'm late for a very important date ! No time to say hello , good-bye ! I'm late I'm late I'm late ! 
Damn TV shows and their ability to make me cry ... 
... The quarters smelled like cookies ... 
hates her browser right now . Went back a < PROPFEMALE > while in the middle of a blog and erased all the thoughts she had written ! 
Nothing like an LED screen sticking out your hoo-ha . 
Mummies is magic . 
Wow , Facebook's all sorts of fucked up today , ain't it ? 
is watching The Mummy whilst sipping delicious tea and cuddling with her cat on her lap . No work tonight ; life is good . 
Y'know a couple years ago , this would've seemed really strange to me . 
Convince me to please you . Make me think that I need this too . I'm trying to let you hear me as I am . 
Happy Turkey Day all . Have fun with family and enjoy yourselves . I will be eating a pre-made rottessierie chicken with my sister before nodding off to work * yet * again tonight . Hopefully mommy can come home soon and I can have my Thanksgiving with the family * before * Christmas comes along ...

Mmm Banquet Fried Chicken ... 
Take on girl wrapped in snuggly sweaters . Add a heater and fleece blanket . Give one portion of shepard's pie and buttermilk buiscut . Add \The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\ " for entertainment . Finish with a < PROPFIRST>'s \ " Whack and Unwrap\ " chocolate orange . Result ? A very happy < PROPFEMALE > home from work ! "

fails at Scattergories . But spent a lovely evening last night with my fam . 
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here , it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable . There is another which states that this has already happened . 
It's a slow day on the internet . 
There is an < PROPMALE > , or rather a knack to flying . The knack is to throw yourself at the ground and miss . 
really truly despises her very ignorant and douche-y boss .

got to be all alone for six hours . Not one visitor . And of course , was paranoid about being alone in the store for six hours with no visitors . Thanks guys . -_- 
Ballet Shoes = movie <3 
is sad that < PROPFEMALE > Murphy is dead now . She was a great actress and far , far too young . 
is looking forward to a good day . Enough money for bills and x-mas shopping , already groceries , now sleep . For later , the boy ( < PROPMALE > Sayman ) will be picking me up for dinner at < PROPFEMALE>'s Place and then on to see Avatar ! 
Wow . 
It's gonna be a < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > fricken Christmas . I must be on < PROPFEMALE > Clause's **** list . The tree , the gifts , the mistletoe kiss . Shoot me now , I'm sick of all my relatives . Have a < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > fricken Christmas !

Nap time . Need a pick-me-up before going out to party all night for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s 21st birthday ! 
I need to stop falling asleep with cough drops in my mouth . 
survived the day shift . To quote \I got by with a little help from my friends . \ " * wink * " 
Black . 
It's a secret no one tells . One day it's heaven , one day it's hell . It's no < PROPFEMALE > tale , take it from me . That's the way it's supposed to be . 
is settling down to catch up on her TV shows . Marathon time ! 
text \Haiti\ " to 90999 to donate $10 to the Red Cross to help the relief fund . :) "

if you have a wonderful husband , fiancé or boyfriend that works hard to provide for you and would do anything just for you , then repost this as your status to give the honest well behaved men out there the recognition that they deserve , because great men are few and far between , and I have one ! 
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill . You can try to stop the seasons girl , but you know you never will . And you can try to stop my dancing feet but I just can not sit still . Cause the world keeps spinning round and round and my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound . I was lost till I heard the drums and I found my way ... 
Darling you had best believe me . Never leave me without love ! 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments ! 
should've taken < PROPFEMALE > up on her offer . At least then one of us would be happy in the love department . Cause mine bailed out on me . Again . Oh well . Have fun , hope you don't catch anything and you're not gonna like the news I have waiting for you . On another note , Facebook changed ? 
Pick a color , any color . 
loves her boyfriend , < PROPMALE > Sayman , on this < PROPFIRST>'s Day and on everyday . You are the best boyfriend I could ask for baby . <3 Miss you ! 
is mad at you now . :( 
will have new information on her rape case in the morning . Apparently , they have a name ... 
You think you see me , like the way I'm strong and stand by you . But I am fragile too ... I am fragile too . 
They're supposed to be arresting him tonight . 
Ok so here's the deal . The dude has been arrested and is now in jail . They have 72 hrs before a disposition is held , and the detective told me she was going to try and avoid that by seeing if she could find a parole violation to hold him on as well . At some point I'm going to have to go with her to talk to the DA but I don't know when . And no , they haven't told me his name yet . 
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus . Running around like a clown on purpose . Who gives a damn about the family you come from . No giving up when you're young and you want some . 
really , REALLY does not want to go to work . Not after the afternoon she just had ... 
So , at 2PM I will be whisked off to a meeting with the DA for my case and the Detective working it . Wish me luck ! 
could be seeing a Grand Jury in as soon as next week . But it's a big \maybe . \""

Hey all , just thought I should let you know ( if you happen to be friends with her as well ) < PROPFEMALE > Schutt is in the hospital with a broken leg/knee . She is at ECMC . Send her well wishes ! 
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time . As far as I'm concerned your just another picture to burn . And the Yankees lost the first game of the season . God really does hate me . 
hates that I somehow ended up as the bad guy when I'm the one who got dumped . Fuck that and fuck you . I'm through crying over it . I'm worth so much more than a guy who can't make up his mind . Your loss . <3 my girlies , who catch me when I fall . You guys are amazing and I love you the most . 
Who doesn't long for someone to hold ? Who knows how to love you without being told ? Somebody tell me why I'm on my own if there's a soulmate for everyone ? 
Thought you said you were different . Is that what I heard you say ? Said that you'd love only me . Thought that you'd be all I need . What happened to promises ? Said that you were a better man . You're words have no weight with me , ' cause you're counterfit I see .

Dear Twitards , \ 
< PROPFIRST > Cullen will never marry you . Neither will < PROPMALE > Black . Or < PROPFIRST > Bieber . Your lives have less and less meaning everytime you say , think or come close to thinking the phrase \I enjoy the Twilight Saga\ " or anything close to 
XBox Kinect demos out in < PROPFEMALE>'s ? The fuck ? 
woke up to a discussion of the meaning of they lyrics of \Raspberry Beret\ " and the nerds she lives with battling Pokemon cards in the living room . Did I wake up on the weird side of the bed today ? " 
is about to shower and steel herself for working a double . Had a FANTASTIC time at the Italian Festival with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and my dad yesterday . Ate waaaay too much food and won 2 prizes at the \I Got It\ " game . BTW Strawberry Banana Kabobs rule hardcore . "

Anybody got a car ( or preferably a < PROPFIRST > or truck ) they want to use to help me move shit ? I'm in dire straights right now ! 
can handle the rampaging geekiness that infects her house , but is getting a little nauseous at all the cutsey couple stuff that's happening . Since I'm sick already , this is not good . Why can everybody else be happy but me ? 
is up very late playing solitary Mahjongg . Does this count as sad ? 
is sick . Work will be fun tonight . 
is about to go do her Grand Jury testimony . While still sick and with hardly any voice . Wish me luck ! 
is still lacking a voice , but had it explained away in GJ by the < PROPFEMALE > . Whilst nauseating , the testimony did go well ; there were no slip-ups but I still wish he'd take the plea and not make me do this again . 
thinks Facebook is acting far too weird . Also , got up to go to a Dr. appt and has to come back n go back to sleep for work after . Fucked up . 
hates some of the prerequisits for being a woman . Just had her annual physical including ... 
is headed to < PROPMALE > for the Ren Fair !

What do all my friends think about me making a < PROPMALE > Kaulitz video to the song \Sharada ? \ " I bet 90% of you hate it . Song to follow soon . " 
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around . It's a hole in the wall , it's a dirty free for all . There's a place I know if you're looking for a show , where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor . 
wonders if boys are ever taught to clean and given chores the way girls are . Just cleaned my bathroom . The only words I can think of are \oh my fucking god . \"" 
wonders how people think some movie ideas are good . There's going to be a Battleship movie ( yes Battleship the board game ) with the plot revolving around alien invasions and it's going to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and Rhianna . Please tell me I'm not the only one that thinks this is gonna suck hardcore .

Happy < PROPFEMALE > has her watch back . :)

is torn between the urge to be free and unbound and painful lonliness . 
is reading the PowerPuff Girls Doujinshi . Suprisingly good , even if it's a massive crossover of bad fanfiction proportions . 
is not sure how his roommate stands his girlfriend's constant whining . If I did that , any of my boyfriends would've bitch slapped me . Does he just have a high tolerance for it or was she just blessed with being epically cute while whining ? 
is so grateful she got to go to Saralyn DaSilva and < PROPFIRST > Sarandis wedding reception . It was the most awesome time and they are the perfect couple . Best wishes to you all !

just realized that the ad next to the YouTube video she's watching is an anti-Paladino ad paid for by Cuomo . The dirtiest race for governor ever is leaking to YT . * facepalm * 
Life Truth #8 : Obituaries would be a lot more interesting if they told you how the person died . 
Life Truth #9 : I can't remember the last time I wasn't at least kinda tired . 
Life Truth #10 : Bad decisions make good stories . \ 
For the most part . Much love to my boy < PROPFIRST > Grande today ! Hoping he finally lands a job ! * fingers crossed *

I turned my profile pic pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month . While I did mine my way , you can go here : http://www.facebook.com/telus\

Life Truth #11 : You don't know when it will strike , but there comes a moment at work where you know you just aren't going to do anything productive for the rest of the day . 
Life Truth #12 : Can we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after Blu-Ray ? I don't want to have to restart my collection ... again . 
Life Truth #13 : I'm always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks if I want to save any changes to my ten-page paper that I swear I did not make any changes to . 
joined a gym . Well ... let's see how this goes . 
Was productive ! Bathroom is now squeaky-clean and smelling pretty ! Well ... Lysol smells better than it did anyway . 
was even MORE productive today ! Went to the gym , went out to the res , visited the fam , and am buying a new phone FINALLY ! 
got almost everything done today . Just finished hitting the gym . Hot Topic here we come ! 
is pissed that there aren't more hours in a day . :/ That would be so much more useful . 
OMG . Why , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , why ? Avatar is a good movie as it is . It doesn't need to be a trilogy . Stop now . 
Happy Halloween ! I'll be at the store in costume ( sorta . ) Wonder how many of you can guess who I am . Here's a hint : the anhk is her symbol . 
Wow what a day ! Worked last night til 7am , went to get Chinese with the boy , and just got back from the gym ! Tonight's agenda is to try and get my apt a little bit neater . Tomorrow's agenda : VOTING , breakfast at mommy's , and then working an odd 3-11 shift . < PROPFEMALE > . 
Remember Remember the fifth of November , the gunpowder treason and plot . I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot . 
' s roommate and bf are currently looking on Google for beastiality porn to win a bet . When did my life get so weird ? 
hates Skyline . It fails so hard . 
has a home fit for guests to visit again . Plus , new job !! Whoohoo !!! 
thinks that the Kinect Dance Central game MIGHT be cooler than DDR . Just a little . YaY more dances to learn ! 
\I couldn't quit you with a 12-step program . \"" 
Happy Thanksgiving all !

Life Truth #14 : \Do not machine wash or tumble dry\ " mean I will never wash this -- ever . " 
Life Truth #15 : I hate when I miss a call by the last ring ( Hello ? Hello ? Crap ! ) but when I immediately call back , it rings 9 times and goes to voicemail . What did you do after I didn't answer ? Drop the phone and run away ? 
\Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon \ 
Life Truth #16 : I hate leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of importance the entire day . What a waste . 
Life Truth #17 : I keep some peoples phone < PROPFIRST > in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call/text . 
8 years ago today ... 
has a 2 hr commute to and from her job in Williamsville . From all the reports I'm hearing ... wish me luck . 
wonders how long Hollywood can crank out good never-ending sequels . Pirates 4 and F&F 5 are good examples . I am a fan , so I wanna see , but by definition of the < PROPFIRST > in their titles , they should suck . So what is one to do ? 
has the headache from hell . Is trying to make it out of the house to go help daddy . Why can't the headache come on a day when I DON'T have stuff to do ? 
wonders if there is anything in this world cooler than glow-in-the-dark nail polish . :) 
\When you're 600 years old there's no such thing as a cougar . \"" 
Holy crap ! 34 unread email messages when I got home ! I know I wrote a lot yesterday but geeze ... 
I'll come back to the FB drama after work . 
wishes she could watch more 21 Jump Street . Instead I gotta go to bed for work . Stupid work . Stupid hr+ commute . Stupid life and responsibilities . I'll answer the FB drama tomorrow . Y'know , you guys should've expected this from me . You know how opinionated and argumentative I am . Quit acting like you're surprised I support this . 
YouTube video catch up , THEN Facebook drama . And hopefully , if I'm not too pissed off , 21 Jump Street . 
< PROPFEMALE > Kissmyassmas ! 
< PROPFEMALE > sigh . Alright FB peoples , leave me alone . From telling me I can't have an opinion on equal rights , to an argument over religions and Christmas ( we all know Jesus wasn't actually born in Dec right ? ) I'm dead beat from all you people . When the only thing making you happy is a discussion on raw foodism and how it affects the raising of a child , your life is pretty sad . 
Are we done yet ?! 
Fish gotta swim , birds gotta fly , I gotta love one man til I die . Can't help lovin ' that man of mine . 
Feels like shit on a lot of different levels . Webcomic catch up to feel better ? 
Fuck this cold man ! 
Not even in school and doing a doing a research paper . WTH ? 
Salad with < PROPFEMALE > and red leaf lettuce , baby spinach , tomatoes , cucumbers , mushrooms and red onions topped with a homemade Italian dressing . WIN . 
21 Jump Street AIDS episode angering me . I know it was the 80's and was progressive for it's time but it's still annoying to see what happened back then . 
Rather offended that the AIDS ep of 21 Jump Street had the hemophiliac kid using that as a ruse and having him secretly be gay . * grumble * 
Doing good on my NYR to eat better : Breakfast is wheat toast w/ crunchy PB and a sliced orange . As my mom will tell you , there are clues in there that I'm doing better . 
You could be a hero/heroes do what's right/you could be a hero/you might save a life/you could be a hero/you could join the fight/for what's right/for what's right/for what's right ... 
is loving 2NE1's stuff right now . And has < PROPFIRST > J's song \Do It Like a Dude\ " stuck in my head as well . " 
Ham sandwich on whole-wheat bread with a sliced orange . NOMS . 
\Great calamity kittens ! \ " <-- Best line ever . " 
You know it's getting too cold out when the world looks like God knocked over her makeup box and spilled the glitter everywhere . 
Time to whip the kitchen back into order . I swear to the Gods I can't keep this place clean to save my life . 
* victory dance * The kitchen is now under my control again ! Mwahahaha ! 
And now , off to shower and then bed . G'night FB ! 
has to help < PROPFEMALE > Schutt figure out Vampire Night and is re-pissed that Shojo Beat is no longer in print . 
Some days I want to scream . There is nothing on this earth that is truly BAD for you , so long as you have it IN MODERATION . Too much of ANYTHING is bad , and even things like Vitamins and Iron can be overdosed on . You CAN have TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING . 
\I just threw up a kittens . \ " LOL ! " 
< PROPMALE > Brando + < PROPFIRST > Sinatra = Guys and Dolls FTW ! 
HOLY COLD BATMAN ! 
I adore Guys and Dolls !

Who parties on a Monday night ? Srsly . 
Thanks so much to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > for a wonderful , fun girls night yesterday ! 
I <3 Pirate's Booty ! 
Life Truth #18 : I think the freezer deserves a light as well . 
Dorm mattresses suck . Ow ow ow ow ow ... 
Life Truth #19 : I disagree with < PROPFEMALE > Jewelers . I would bet that on any given Friday or Saturday night , more kisses begin with Blue Light than with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Medaille's internet sucks . Glad to be back home , but wish the boy could be with me . 
Woke up to P!nk's \Raise Your Glass\ " in my head and had it change to Will Smith's \ " Gettin ' Jiggy wit It . \ " WTF is wrong with the radio in my head ? " 
Life Truth #20 : I wish Google Maps ( or any other map site ) had an \avoid ghetto\ " routing option . " 
Also , ShanaLogic.com's Lime Crime Mineral Makeup is the shit . 
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare . Either way I don't wanna wake up from you . Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare . Somebody pinch me , you're love's too good to be true . 
\For who could ever learn to love ... a beast ? \ " \ 
\Lafou I'm afraid I've been thinking . \"" 
I would marry the beast to have a library like that . 
Step out the front door like a ghost into a fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white . In between the < PROPFEMALE > and you , angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right . \ 
Name the song that ' s going through my head . 
Had a fantastic night yesterday with < PROPFEMALE > Dukarm , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Grande and < PROPFEMALE > Buskey . Had to work today though and came out to ... 
... terrible , horrible , no good , very bad , fucking shitty ass snowstorm . Walked half an hour in the snow to get home without being able to see through my glasses because it was STILL faster than the bus ... 
Then shoveled enough so I can get out of the damn house again . Let's hope it doesn't get worse . Going to console myself with a cannoli-filled cupcake and a mango . 
After a crappy start to the morning , things are lookin up . 
Wow what long day ! Feels longer than it was , and i'm way more tired from it than usual . 
What hurts the most was being so close . And having so much to say . And watching you walk away . And never knowing what could have been . And not seeing that loving you is what I was trying to do . \ 
Cascada cover of the song . Love it , love her ... yeah . 
Singing myself to sleep with < PROPFIRST > J's \Do It Like A Dude . \ " Goodnight world . " 
Woke up to Avenue Q in my head . Care for an \Everyone's a Little Bit Racist\ " sing-a-long ? " 
Holy crap snow ! This is not what I went to bed to . 
Nom nom tuna sub . With spinach , red onions , green peppers and black olives . 
is having the transportation day from hell . Halp ? 
Hell yeah ! This is more like it ! Gettin warmer out , the trnsportation issue shouldn't be an issue ... let's hope the shift goes well . 
Anyone care to explain to me why there are TSA agents , police & drug sniffing dogs in the University train station ? 
Also , really God ? You could've at least melted the snow a little more first . 
Okay , there should not be an \Act of God\ " market for the farm industry . That's ridiculous . " 
So my NYR to cut out pop failed over the weekend . Why does < PROPFEMALE > ale have to be the best thing for upset tummies ? 
Cuz I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it . Sex in the air , I don't care , I love the smell of it . Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me . :) 
Mad . Recently read Little Women . Did not realize there were 3 other books needed to complete the saga . Now need those books . 
OMG . Day from hell finally over with . Fuck work man . 
Definitely had a better after-work day . Chilled with < PROPFEMALE > Schutt and the boy < PROPFIRST > Grande and had delicious creamsicle millkshakes at the Lake Effect Diner . On a side note , those need more orange in them . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > boom boom . 
We the unknowing are doing the impossible for the ungrateful . We have done so much for so long with so little , we are now qualified to do anything with nothing ! 
We the unwilling , led by the unknowing , are doing the impossible for the ungrateful . We have done so much for so long with so little , we are now qualified to do anything with nothing ! \ 
That's how it should have gone . Oops . 
Happy Pi day ! Going out with the boy , < PROPFIRST > Grande , for lunch as a belated birthday present . Then possibly mall with my two sisters , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
Life Truth #21 : Sometimes I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the heck was going on when I first saw it . 
Home early from work and it is SUCH a beautiful day out that I'm going to take my skipping-rope out for a bit ! Goal : To be able to skip to 100 or more by the end of the summer . 
Life Truth #22 : I would rather try to < PROPFEMALE > 10 overloaded bags in each hand then take 2 trips to bring my groceries in . 
May you live a long life full of gladness and health , \ 
with a pocket full of gold as the least of your wealth . \ 
May the dreams you hold dearest be those which come true , \ 
and may the kindness you spread keep returning to you . \

Life Truth #24 : Sometimes I have a hard time deciphering the fine line between boredom and hunger . ( I refuse to do Life Truth #23 on this list because I don't believe in it . ) 
Life Truth #25 : How many times is it appropriate to say \What ? \ " before you just nod and smile because you STILL didn't hear or understand a word they just said ? " 
Life Truth #26 : I love the sense of camaraderie when an entire line of cars team up to prevent a jerk from cutting in at the front . Stay strong , brothers and sisters ! \ 
I don't even drive and I love it when this happens ! 
Life Truth #27 : Shirts get dirty . Underwear gets dirty . Pants ? Pants never get dirty and you can wear them forever . 
Life Truth #28 : Is it just me , or do high school kids get dumber and dumber every year ? 
Forgotten Life Truth : When I'm alone in the house and I hear a strange noise , I immediately presume I'm going to be killed . 
Life Truth #29 : There's no worse feeling than that millisecond you're sure you are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too far . 
I find it amusing that the commercial on the video I'm watching is for how much better T-Mobil is than AT&T . Guess who just bought T-Mobil out ? That's right , AT&T . 
Care Bears : The Next Generaton . Starry < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > as Fuzzy Wuzzy Has No Hair .

Forgotten Life Truth : I hate when I wash pants and have to break them back in again . The pants that fit perfectly when they went in the wash are now a pain to get back on . 
How much of a nerd am I right now ? Rockin ' out to some old-ass 98 Degrees in my bedroom .
