All of this totals close to a hundred dollars-a hundred dollars I could spend on people I actually like . Bah humbug ! 
JETS !!!!!! 
Being a Jets fan is a road paved with heartache and disappointment . How quickly we forget . 
ugh , siiiccckkk . 
catching up on Glee is the one up side of being home sick . 
If you are shopping today at the Smithhaven Mall , come visit me at Soma ! I will be there 3-7 ! :) 
full-blown sick again . Ugh . I though I beat this one . Home today , writing papers , eating soup and trying to recover . 
I am still sick , blech ! On a positive note , I have advanced several stages in Angry Birds . 
Just heard the terrible news about < PROPFIRST > Sandfort . My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends . 
eating a big slice of humble pie . 
my car battery is officially dead . :( 
< PROPMALE>'s dad came and rescued my broken car today ! Dads rule !

end of the semester means returning the entire suitcase full of library books I have out . 
shopping baking wrapping . 
five more hours and < PROPMALE > Roscigno will be officially on vacation !! I am so excited for Christmas ! 
Done shopping and wrapping and cooking . Early morning shift at the mall , then all that is left to do is relax and enjoy ! 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > nap . Heavenly . 
Wishing everyone a safe , happy , healthy holiday ! 
Had a wonderful Christmas visiting all my family . It was so nice to see everyone ! 
Staying an extra day in Jersey because we couldn't possibly drive today ! 
trying to get back to L.I. today !! Wish us luck !! 
drinking hot chocolate out of my new Anthropologie mug . It makes it taste better . 
< PROPMALE > just came up with a great idea for a show : American Pickers combined with Hoarders . So good . 
poor < PROPMALE > came home from work today with a 103 fever ! Not a good way to start the new year . :( 
So excited for < PROPFEMALE > Smith and Irra Vinokur to come visit ! 
LET\S GO JETS !!!!!!! " 
Stranded on < PROPFEMALE > during what was supposed to be a very busy and productive day in the city . But laying around drinking coffee in my pajamas with < PROPMALE > is a suitable alternative !! 
My thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of < PROPFEMALE > Parman . Such a tragic loss . 
Is anyone watching this show about coupon people on TLC ? I am so inspired . 
J-E-T-S ! JETS , JETS , JETS ! I love my Jets ! Can't wait for next week !! 
Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Patriots fan . Being a Patriots fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is no known cure for PF and sympathy does not help but , with your help we can raise awareness . 100% of JETS fans will repost this , simply because we know how to copy and paste . GO JETS !!!! 
Go Jets ! 
Sad . Football sad . 
Two years in a row . :( 
The new Blackboard is confusing and an eyesore . Can I get an \Amen ? \"" 
Yucky snowy commute ! 
I came home from a long , slushy commute and < PROPMALE > made me dinner aanndd he made brownies ! :) I am the luckiest girl in the world ! 
I have decided that I am jealous of people that have hobbies and I need to get one . Problem is , I don't know what hobby I would get . Tennis ? Archery ? Needlepoint ? 
The most excellent part of college/grad school is that there are TWO first days of school a year ! <--------------- super nerd . 
The guy next to me on the train is reading Podiatry Today , and it has a giant picture of a foot on the cover ! LOL !! Cover Girl ! 
< obligatory complaint about the snow/ice/roads/school-work-cancellation/non-cancellation > 
I over heard a conversation between two of my students today . \ 
\ 
Student 1 : I am going to get a tattoo . \ 
Student 2 : Oh yeah , of what ? \ 
Student 1 : It is going to be words that say \follow the sun . \ " \ 
last day at my retail job !!! So excited to have time to really focus on school and finishing my thesis . :) 
In case there was any doubt that I am a super-nerd ... I have bifocals now . I want to give myself a wedgie . 
Este flan es increíble ! 
< PROPMALE > and I are spending our < PROPFIRST>'s Day apart , both of us at our respective works/schools until late ... but working hard so our future life together will be the kind we want is pretty romantic to me . <3 
Does anyone use Keynote for presentations ? I have had about enough of PowerPoint and its auto-format frustrating nonsense . 
In the non-Black-Eyed-Peas sense , I have a feeling today is going to be a good day . 
Jazz and coffee . 
Countdown to new < PROPFEMALE > starts now .... 
I am a public employee . I am NOT the problem . Police Officers , Teachers , Paramedics , Firefighters , Nurses , Road Workers etc . are NOT the enemy . If youre jealous of our benefits , FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN ! Not against ours . The < PROPMALE > who CREATED this crisis are putting middle class families against each other . We LIVE here , PAY taxes , WORK HARD & TRY to support our families too . If you're a public employee , copy & repost . 
My < PROPMALE > historian friends will appreciate this-I have been doing so much reading that last night both < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Jones were in my dream ! 
Does anyone else think that it is weird how they keep telling the American Idol contestants to \sing for your life\ " ? It sounds like they are going to execute them if they lose . " 
AHHH ! Jersey Shore is in Point Pleasant ! 
feeling like I have a plan and some energy to complete it for the first time since this semester started . A short break really helped put this all in perspective . Thesis stress is temporarily under control . :) 
all of a sudden my throat is swollen , I have a headache and I feel really tired . UGHHHH . Not now , sickness . I am really hoping that some emergen-C and zinc tablets can knock this thing out of me before tomorrow . 
Z-pack attack ! 
Went for an awesome bike ride with < PROPMALE > ! LOVING our new bikes ! Happy Spring !!! 
Had a lovely day outlet shopping with < PROPFIRST > ' Toscano ' Citrano and < PROPFEMALE > ' Rubino ' Dixon ! 
Everything is falling into place and it feels really good ! 
Happy Opening Day !! Let's go Yankees !!! 
One year ago today , I quit smoking-the best decision I ever made !
