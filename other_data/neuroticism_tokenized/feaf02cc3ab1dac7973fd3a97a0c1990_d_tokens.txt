I miss those warm summer nights , where we stayed up until 2 am , screaming and goofing around with the grage lit . the smell of oil and gas ; the sounds of powertools and saws going . They always make me think of you . What I wouldn't give to have you back . The way you used to be . The tire swing in the backyard , when we lit up fireworks , and cooked smores infront of the barn .. Imissyoudad .

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious .

I'm so tired of feeling lonely . Is there this secret ' keep away from me!' circle I have around me ? 
Holyhell . I'm a senior . =.=; I still rememberwhen I was laughing as a freshmen who was gonna ' be the Corps commander my senior year . Now I look back and laugh . It's scary . I'm ready for it , but I don't wanna ' leave . welp , tomorrow's my last first day of school . Hellooo senior year .

Woo ! Marksmanship tomorrow . 8D sweet . gotta ' leave extra early . -o- 
Today , I was at my girlfriends house with just me and her . Things began to get heated and we started doing it on the living room couch . Near the end of it I decided to whisper in her ear , \Who's your daddy ? \ " I hear behind me 
Be kinder than necessary , for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle . 
.. Is the 30th here yet ..? 
Does not and will not like this day . At all . 
Today just doesn't wanna ' get better , does it ? I wake up in the morning to find someone hit my PARKED car . I have no side mirror now and a dent in my door . x ] School was .. school . Have to rush to get ready for the game tonight and .. Hopefully picking on the freshmen will cheer me up . :3 
after the volleyball game was pretty okay . freshmen are freaky this year . And freakkin ' loud . 7/30 freshies showed up to the game . Fail . 
We're not falling in love , we're just falling apart . 
Tired . I really don't wanna ' do my Econ and english homework .. 
Don't make me promises if you can't keep them , stop trying to make excuses ; I know they're just lies . 
Great . The only thing I had some self-confidence in is gone , now what do I do when I'm below , below average ? 
I need a hug , like one of those guy hugs they give you and everything feels better . Am I just setting my standards o high for me ? .. Or do I really just excell at nothing .. 
Woo ! Sports day omorrow , then going home and sleeping . :D have to get up at like five thirty tomorrow . School was Eh . I'm still Eh . 
You all should be jealous . I've got BOTH my side-view mirros again . ;D 
Sore , but Today was pretty amazingly fun . My last year going , kinda ' sad we didn't win the Spirit award . :S oh well . 
\Me - Dude 
Am I really that bad of a person ? Sorry for trying to help and sorry for being a shitty friend . Not even gonna ' try to talk to people tomorrow . I'll be another walking epmty shell . 
Sometimes the most open minded people are the ones who're the most closed minded . 
Stop making promises you wont keep , It's not that hard . If you KNOW for a FACT you can keep it , make a promise . Though , if you DON'T know for a FACT don't make a promise . 
Votes on that we should have a Movie party Monday , < PROPFEMALE > Webster . >:o And perhaps we should invite freshies to get to know ' em . 
Who knew writing an enlgish paper could be so depressing ? Going to bed , WAY to tired to clean the kitchen at this point . goodnight . 
I'm fersrsly low on gas , and we're kinda ' short on money for now , so it'd be really FREAKIN ' helpful if you could give me my money . kthx . 
Woooow .. REALLY ? Well , gee , thanks . :/ 
Thank you , ' friend ' . :/ 
Nice to know you'd rather spend money than pay me back , when we don't have money for gas . :] 
Maan , everyone has someone to love on now'a days . Why am I always the one who's alone ..? 
No matter how much you care , you can't make others care . 
So , I'm pretty sure I've got 13 misqueto bites on my left arm , and seven on my right . 
So what do you do when you're below , below average ? :/ 
As happy as you make me , you also make me three times sadder . 
niight peoples . Uniform day tomorrow , fuji afterwards for Brittanys birthdaaay ! 
I wish I could hit you with a bat . :/ 
Well , the day was going okay , but now i'm all sadface . Urk . Just gotta ' get over it I guess . 
Goodbye my almost lover , goodbye my hopeless dream ; i'm trying to not think about you , can't you just let me be ?

Do you not have faith in me ..? 
Lawl . Silly me . How can I help anyone like me , if I can't even help myself ? 
I feel a breakdown comin ' up . hmm , I predict tomorrow . 
Good god . people need to get off my ass . I don't live to please you , can't you see i've had a bad day ? Just leave me alone , and if you've got a problem wth me , kick me out of your life , then . 
With bad comes the good , and horrid more the great . 
I'm just gonna ' go ahead and warn everyone now . I have no patients right now , and probably wont tomorrow . Don't get mad if I seem .. not so nice . :D 
Tiimmeee to go drop off my uniform at the dry cleanerss . Be right back . 
\Shut up you dirty little hamster ! \ " - Mike . \ 
Good gosh . :/ If i'm THAT annoying to you , quit talkin ' to me . It's not that hard ' cause apparently I'm important to you . 
Good gosh . :/ If i'm THAT annoying to you , quit talkin ' to me . It's not that hard ' cause apparently I'm not important to you . 
Goodbye my almost lover , goodbye my hopeless dream . I'm trying not to think about you , can't you just let me be ? So long my luckless romance my back is turned on you ; shoulda ' known you'd bring me heartache . Almost lovers always do . 
The Comp went well . ' cept the whole running around like chickens with our heads cut off . >:/ My feet hurrrttt . But , we took first advance overall . ;] Off to Fuji at Five with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . <3 and then .. Iunno ' .

Gonna ' play GameCube all night and drown out these depressing thoughts .. 
I can't wait until October 15th . :s 
Stop being mad at the world for what you did . 
It's like I'm not even here any more . I can't tell what's fictional and non-fictional . I hear people talking and barely understand or respond . What's wrong with me ? 
LKASBDFKASJDFBSDF . NOTHING I do is right to you . I'm always wrong . WRONGWRONGWRONGWRONG . you've always gotta ' be right , don'tcha ? I just want to talk to you , and all you can do is bitch n ' moan . 
If I can make sense of what others feel .. Maybe I can make sense of what I feel . 
Why can't peole be honest ? <--- answer it . 
May I make a\ 
request of anyone willing to post this to their profile for at least an\ 
hour-It is Special Education Week and this is in honor of all\ 
children-made in a unique way and who learn a little ... differently . And\ 
to those who dedicate their lives to helping these special children .

Can't find my fkujyhgrfryhukhf keys !! AGH !! 
Found me keys , finally ! Off to my tattoo touch up . Then coming back home to clean , then hopefully going to go hangout with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > to look for postcards . :D 
So , who knew that tattoo touch-ups are three times worse then the actual tattoo ? 
Gooooooood ! My back itches ! >.< 
I love how people wait until the last day of fall break to do homework . Pfft . \ 
I freakin ' wait until first block to do fourth block's work . :D 
I think Inuyasha is the ONLY anime I prefer in english . \ 
Other than that , today blows . \

Kinda ' like a trained whore . \ 
Wait , I mean EXACTLY like a whore . 
You know what I want for christmas ? All the freakin ' soundtracks to Inuysahs . ESPICALLY the opening/ending songs . : c 
My day was pretty amazin ' . Until 1730 . O: oh well ! \ 
I'm the new Marksmanship commander . (: 
People need to learn that the FAST < PROPFIRST > on the bypass doesn't mean to go FOURTY-FIVE , DAMNIT . \

XDD 
I was planning on dipping my cookies in milk , but they're so undercooked i can't pick ' em up . : c BUT THEY WERE DELICIOUS . \ 
Like mashed potatoes but in smushed cookie form .

I'll try it , too .

Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer 
Whatever\ 
you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will\ 
give you a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her\ 
groceries , she will give you a meal . Give her a smile and she will give\ 
you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So if you\ 
.... give her crap , be ............ ready to receive a ton of shit ... \ 
Real women keep this going ! 
Wrote a new poem . \ 
Quite in love with it . 
ease feel free to stop playing the victim only one person thinks you are that and he's blind . Unlike me . :) 
Since my phone likes to mess up my messages .. GOD , i hate people , oh so freakin ' much . Today was shitty . People need to learn that the FAST < PROPFIRST > means FASTER . not freakin ' 55 ! Another note .. Please , feel free to stop playing the victim :) there's only two people who think you are and they're blind to your shit . But , we're not . ;)

Anyone want to be an amazing friend and let me borrow a phone for a little bit ? :/ 
You could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath , I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt . 
K .. So , my phone is fersrsly crap . It wont charge . It only works when it's ON the charger . By ' works ' i mean it will restart constantly and not let me call people or recieve txts when i need them . SO . If ANYONE has a spare phone , and god i don't care when kind it is , PLEASE let me use it ! D: >_< I really really need it to keep in touch with my mom and all that . 
How do you make a flesh color with paint ?! 
It's so weird . i haven't been this happy in a while . And it's not just a few hours , it's been a few days . \ 
I seriously think this painting every other day is seriously saving me from myself . \ 
I still suck at drawing and such , but i'll get better . I can't wait until I'm better . 
Totally made Sango look like a mexican . : cc I'm sorry , Sango !

Applied at Kmart .. >_> ehehehe . Let's hope I get it ! Night .

that standing ovation was beyond amazing . Makes me sad this is my last\ 
year . :/ i think the realization is sitting in .. I don't wanna ' grow up . 
Stop ! Don't touch me there , that's my nono square ! 
Going skating in a little bit . Yaya 
Everything I do is wrong , isn't it ? Sorry for having fun for once . I really am sorry for being a bad friend . 
Ever have those days where everything goes wrong and you just want to cry ? Yeah . Me freakin ' too . \ 
Oh . No one can come over to my house for a while anymore . Don't ask why , you just can't . 
Don't forget . It's Marksmanship tomorrow . and all week . Spread the word to the other MMS people . 
Humans make mistakes . I make more than usual . \ 
Does that make me inhuman ? 
If you love someone because they have a good personality , or if they're cute or has a nice body it's pointless to say you love them , because someone who's nicer , or hotter will come along . There's always someone better . You love someone because you love them . Not their qualities . 
The blindest of all \ 
are people with open eyes\ 
the blind always sees\ 
past their own lies . 
Just finished watching Tyoko Mew Mew . I cried . But , i've been crying all day , so ! But , still it was a good anime . Sad it's over , but eh . i'll find a new one ! Doctors tomorrow . sleep now . night . 
I hate being this freakin ' sick ! I can hardly breathe , my lips are so chapped and any kind of chapstick just makes it worse . My body is sooo achey , i can't stop coughing , my nose is so clogged , neck hurts . Eff me . Anyone want to bring me some soup ..? : c 
Off to the doctors .

You've only got yourself to blame . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > in the sky , \ 
Why are you so bright ? \ 
Maybe because now , \ 
Is see things in a different light . 
Maybe i should hate you for this ; Never really did ever quite get that far . \ 
If I'm just bad news , then you're a liar . 
Marksmanship tomorrow morning . If you didn't do the postal last time , but want to do the next postal , please come . 0650 
It's your own choice to be happy or not . No one else has that control . 
Just kinda ' bummed in general . Dad's birthday is tomorrow so i'm gonna ' call him then . \ 
The smell of a car leaking some weird fluid hit me today and I wanted to cry . \ 
I think I miss my dad . \

Almost finished with my first artwork for my project . Just gotta ' paint the black lines . Off to school in the morning ! Uniform day , gotta ' take a test in ess in the morning . G'night . 
I think the biggest thing that annoys me is when people cut me off mid-sentence . 
You break up with someone because they change , or you break up with someone because they won't change . But , some stay together because they're so in love , they don't see any change . <3 
don't need an angel on my Christmas tree . I already have one in heaven\

What would you do if you knew how and when you would die ? Would you live your life in denial , or try to prevent it with all your might ? Would you be lazy and party and just destroy yourself , or would you make something of your life before you died ..?

When you're in love , no one will ever see them the way you do . 
trolololol 
Everyone thinks your eyes are filled with happiness , love and joy . \

If they stared a little longer they'd notice the cold , dead , emptiness of your soul that I see . 
Everything has beauty , it just takes the right eyes to see it . 
Yep , there is Marksmanship practice tomorrow morning . 
Welp , I don't get a day off work until Sunday . Don't bother asking if I can < PROPFEMALE > out . I also work V-day , too . Ah well , not like it mattered to me .

I want a day off . I'm sick , and I haven't had a day off in a week , and so far my next day off is next Sunday . My body is so weak right now . I wanna crawl back in bed 
Can't do < PROPFIRST > shit right . 
I'm well aware it looks like I've never slept a day in my life . Please stop pointing it out . : c 
Just got a three dollar tip . :D 
So , I asked \can you read what's in my heart ? \"" 
C'mon pops , it's time to go to rainbow land ! \ - < PROPFIRST >." 
Off to shoot the comp now . Wish me luck . 
Yes , once again I'm aware I look like I haven't slept in two weeks . Please stop telling me I look tired . :/ 
So stressed , so sick , so much homework and so tired . I'm tired of everything ! I can't wait until the only kind of stress I have will be College homework and work . 
Sorry I'm not perfect . I can't control my stress as well as you can . There's only so much I can handle and i'm defiantly stretched past my limit . 
Someone should come to subway on 60 and cheer me up . 
Your eyes speak louder than your fake lips . 
So , apparently there's this chef at fuji's named < PROPFIRST > according to my mom . I don't understand why an asian born in his native country would be named < PROPFIRST > . This made me headshake . 
Just got home and now time to cram in a few hours of homework before I can sleep ! 
Everyone is a genius , but if you judge a fish by it's ability to climb a tree , it will believe it's stupid for the rest of it's life . - < PROPFIRST > Enstien 
Playing some tales of symphonia right now , waiting for < PROPFIRST > to come stay the night , then to paint ! Hood day . <3 
Someone -anyone come visit me at work please . 
How many times will I break before I shatter ? 
If you want to be happy , don't count on others to do it for you . 
I see past that smile ; your eyes tell me everything . 
:| I guess I can predict the future . Go figure ! I knew this would happen . Thank you so very muuuuccch . 
Sitting at home , wishing I was at Great Grandpa's memorial with all my family . I wish I could've gone with them ..
