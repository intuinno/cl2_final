Tomorrow is going to be like the first day of school all over again . 
Uploading pictures takes forever . 
Gosh , the exercises my physical therapist gave me are hard . They aren't hard by themselves , but trying to do all six of them in one sitting is difficult . 
O ' great Heavens , open yourself and dump a pile load of snow on us ! Please . You know you want to . 
OMG my Atm and my debit card came today ! The debit card even has the raised < PROPFIRST > and is blue and everything ! In Mom's opinion , my atm card looks fake . ;) My atm card unfortunately doesn't have raised < PROPFIRST > , therefore it is not as cool .

Black light party ruled . I probably made a fool of myself dancing , but I don't care . ;)

At < PROPFEMALE > Beach . I should've brought my electric violin and I could've gone busking , but I didn't think about it . 
Went swimming and got a hermit crab . Need suggestions for a name . 
My hermit crab made an escape attempt last night . Fortunately < PROPFEMALE > saw him and once the crab was safely secured inside his cage he was relocated to the closet with a box of baby wipes and a bottle of shampoo on top of said cage . 
Time to upload the 200 some pictures that have been cluttering up my phone since I've gotten it . Facebook here they come . 
Mom says my hermit crab is a smart ass . 
Poor < PROPFIRST > had an asthama attack at < PROPFEMALE > Stampede . At least I got to see most of the show and get my apple pie . :)

Good luck at the band concert tomorrow ! I <3 all of my band homies :) 
Had a bad day at Wal-Mart . I was putting < PROPFEMALE>'s sock back on and her wheelchair tipped over . I had a hard time trying to lift her back up because < PROPFEMALE > and her chair together weigh at least fifty pounds , and I'm only supposed to be lifting ten . You know what was even worse ? Literally two feet away , these two ladies were standing there staring and DIDN'T BOTHER TO HELP ME . They didn't even ask if < PROPFEMALE > was alright !

Irrational is just another word for insanity XD 
I'm bored ... I feel like prank calling someone ... but who to call ? So many choices ... I have a phone book at my finger tips lol ... 
It makes sense ... if you don't think about it too much XD 
Its an innocent dream/ With an innocent appeal/ Why does everyone bring it down/ Try to take it/ Try to steal it/ I only want to go up up up/ Is my dream going to be tainted/ By men in white who tell me its unreal/ Its only surreal/ Give me pills to take it away/ Tell me this is ideal/ I know what I saw/ I know what I see/ My dream is what makes me free :) 
My 5 year old sister just told me i was \out of control\ " lol i am such a wild child XD " 
In the words of the great < PROPFIRST > Zappa \communism doesn't work because people like to own stuff\ " hehe I totally agree :) " 
Just got done with this science fair stuff . After I had tested all of the lures just for fun i stuck my finger in tank and wiggled it and the goldfish came and bit it lol :)

“Was he some kind of lover ? ” ..... \
