Woke up to find my passenger's side door and window drenched in BBQ sauce as if my car was a fucking baby back rib ! * Sigh * Hate people who got to go and be pieces of shit , just for some fulfillment in their pathetic lives . 
Exasperated With Stupid People !!! And There Are Sooooo Many ! 
Teeth glistenin ' and shinin ' , \ 
Listening to ourselves lying , \ 
Believing the bleeding ego , still tryin ' 
Just took a shower , now going to sleep ( and I don't even work graveyards ! ) . I have a TERRIBLE Circadian Rhythm 
Getting more $ than expected on Payday is ALWAYS pretty sweet ! All this month's bills will be paid with one week's pay . Now save damn near everything for the next 3 weeks ! :) 
Happy Mother's Day to all the Mothers . If you didn't push til ' you pooped we wouldn't be here today ! :) 
Is it normal for a rash to be stinging after you put anti-itch cream on it ? And NO , it's not a rash in the nether regions 
Management jacked my hours without 48 hours notice . < PROPMALE>'s hooking me up with grievance pay . Getting 5 hours pay that I didn't end up working . Thanks Union #367 ! 
Is there a setting where you can optionally choose to NOT get a notification for EVERY DAMN TIME someone posts on a pic you posted on at one point ? I don't care how big the thread gets . It annoying !!! 
Facebook is great and everything , but it's made some people introverted social networking whores . Simply clicking \Like\ " on wall posts of people you no longer ever have face to face contact with is not my idea of retaining a good friendship ! " 
The very first TMNT movie still hasn't lost it's appeal . Pure Nostalgia ... 
Anyone have a printer w/ black ink i can come over and use ??? i can bring my laptop and plug it in . 
Damn you Taco < PROPFEMALE > ... 
PSN is BACK , my friends !!! 
\Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to 
Sick of finding bird shit on my car ! Anyone down for some hunting ? 
6 Facebook friends liked the < PROPFEMALE > \I love being black\ " .... 2 are ACTUALLY black . Something is wrong .... " 
< PROPMALE > Green rapping with Xzibit . THAT was a funny video ! 
Just finding out about all this 5/20/2011-5/21/2011 judgment day crap .... stupid . Won't be today . Won't be 2012 . Just live it up regardless and get out of the retarded apocalypse hype 
The one time I look out my window all day and what do I see ? A dumbass not stopping on his skateboard fast enough to avoid slamming into my car ... 
It always throws me off when I cross paths with a really cute girl who has really bad body odor ... 
Wants to live to see the day where we have full 24 hour access to the other 90% of our brain and the stuff in our subconscious OR the fabled \Time Machine \"." 
Anyone down for Bumbershoot this year ? 
Who goes out and does their SERIOUS food shopping at 5AM ? I Doooo !!! 
Rent paid , Apartment FULL of groceries , and my gas tank is full ( at $3.50 /gallon ) ... Simply put , I'm happier than a pig in shit :) 
\Green\ " Day ( Not the band ) " 
\Feel kinda crappy so I'm gonna sleep til ' I gotta go to work\ " day ... " 
Can't believe how much tax dollars get spent on crap . Sure wish I could KEEP it 
3,596 songs ... Time to siphon some ( of what I now no longer care for ) off of the IPOD 
FUCK YOU SAFEWAY !!!! Soooooo getting a new ( 2nd ? ) job when I get back from vacation 
Normalcy is highly underrated ... 
New Facebook Idea - A notification when you get unfriended : \(Your name here ) terminated your friendship . You must really suck ! \"" 
NEED SUGGESTIONS OF GOOD MOVIES TO DOWNLOAD !!! 
DINNER : Steak Quesadillas and Frosted Flakes . SOUNDS GRRREEAAAAT ! 
HAPPY 15th ANNIVERSARY , RESIDENT EVIL !!! ( Yes , I wished a happy anniversary to a Video Game legend ) 
W .... T ..... FFF ?!?!?!?! 
The week before my trip and the weekend of Taste of Tacoma and Hempfest , my bank screws me . FML 
F*ck Hay Fever of the nasal variety ! Too bad it's NOT terminal , because then it would just kill me 
Colorado bound in about 5 hours ! Woohoo ! I need a vacation 
Potential Job opportunity making +$20/hr ! I'm invited to see em hurr pretty soon :) 
Holy Shit ! It feels good to be home ... 
Through keen observation of one's self , I find I'm slowly changing and NOT for the better nor am I sure what I should do about it ... 
Guess I'll start this True Blood series ... If it blows I can always just stop 
Working interview tomorrow for a reception job at $10/hr again . Sounds good to me . Would love to leave Slaveway Deli :) 
Walls seem to offer protection from a hostile world and give us a sense of control , of keeping people where we think they ought to be . However with any wall there's the question not just of what are you keeping out , but also what are you holding in ? 
KILLED that interview . I think by Monday I'll be employed back at full-time in an office . Yeah ... Hell yeah 
My < PROPFEMALE > st. Taco < PROPFEMALE > ladies hooked me up with free food ! I'm so looooved :) 
Find out tomorrow if I can leave Slaveway and pursue something where I actually make money and don't sweat my ***** off . Now .... the waiting game 
FUUUUUCCCKKKK !!!! And i'm not gonna apologize for the lack of censorship 
TIME FOR A DISTRACTION : Bump some tunes and clean my apartment 
Am I the only one getting tired of \no homo \"?!" 
Today is National Junk Food Day ? Guess I'll celebrate the way I do everyday : Eating my usual diet 
2 Job interviews lined up . Sunday AND Tuesday . I really gotta land one of these . It won't be the end of the world if I don't , but it could be the beginning of something great ( ME MAKING MORE $$$) !! 
\There is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy \"" 
Wouldn't it be great if we could record and get back all the time we give ( hours , days , weeks , months , years ) of our lives doing things that we regretted or were a total loss/waste ? 
PS3 got the yellow-light of death ... ( insert long string of tourette's syndrome ranting here ) . I can't believe this ! 
Another interview in 9 hours . It will be nice when I get hired for something that pays better with better hours so I can stop going to all of these . Interviews are starting to feel like a 2nd job 
It's hard to be the good guy when so many people piss you off 
Life may have thrown A LOT of bullshit my way , but despite all that at least I can say at 24 I have a job , license , and my own place . I'm reliable , independent , live by no ones rules but my own , and don't have to take anyone's shit . It's not the life I imagined or dreamt of , but not entirely the life I feared either . 
\I'll see you at the bitter end ... \"" 
I know absolutely nothing about car audio equipment or how to fix much , yet I managed to ghetto-fashion and repair a blown speaker . \ 
Back to bass in the trunk without crappy distortion !! Hell Yeah !! 
I'll never reach the point of taking desperate measures because I have my pride , but I'm about ready to pull every hair out by the roots 
Direct deposit of a nice paycheck is approaching .... Woop Woop ! 
Didn't think I drank that much but a whiskey and coke and 2 long beaches had me JUST waking up at 1:30 pm . Time to eat 
Cashier and dispatcher interviews this week ! I'm making a bit of a commute so let's hope one of em ' wants to hire me 
Chocolate Martini and Long Beached Iced Tea to soothe the beast within . Breakfast sandwich to absorb the alcohol within commencing here directly . 
Slept 3 hours and went and got my car diagnosed at 8am . Sooo tired and just set myself up for a job interview in 3 hours !!! Hope I won't be so tired I can't think on my feet . I think I'll stuff my face . Something I eat is bound to be brain-food 
PLANKING : WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW F*CKIN ' STUPID THIS FAD IS ! \Ooooh i'm gonna lay stiff as a board flat on my stomach and this is how I'll stick it to the man ! \ " Who comes up with this stuff ? If this is a source of today's entertainment I fear for the future . " 
A.I. = Artificial Intelligence - That's what half the people on facebook have 
\I\ " is a cold word ; \ " we\ " has a warmer sound . \ " Us\ " rings sweeter on the ear than \ " me \"" 
Ugh ! Gonna cost almost $ 1,000 to fix all the shit wrong with my Honda . Today I think i'm gonna pay for the most expensive part of the fix . Bye Bye $350 :( 
I could spend all the money I make having fun , but I don't . I spend a lot of my time too broke to do the things I'd like to do , but rather the things I need to to get by through my days by my own means/resources and without having to use people or always ask for help . At this point in my life self-satisfaction and pride are above entertainment . 
I'd rather be single than relationship retarded bouncing back and forth over and over because I'm too terrified to be alone so i'll settle for less outta desperation or an incapacity to be independent . Some may say I don't try hard enough . I say some try too hard 
I keep hoping to wake up from this bad dream , but I won't .... Someone broke into and stole my car . And people wonder why I think < PROPFEMALE > is a load of shit 
What kinda low-life fuck steals my car FROM MY RESIDENCE , pulls off the back license plate so the cops have a harder time finding it , then strip it for parts ?! Fuck ! It's at < PROPMALE>'s towing and they want me to pay $250 for a car that isn't even in operating condition anymore . Bye Honda . I'll miss you :( Back on foot ... 
< PROPMALE>'s Towing .... What a bunch of DICKS ! 
Seen my car and don't remember the last time I been so upset . Took the trunk top , driver side door , 3 tires , all rims , both jacks in the trunk and the spare , my deck , my switchblade ( which is prolly what they used to < PROPFIRST > it up with scratches and profanity ) , the battery , and even the few pennies I had in it . My car got RAPED ! I don't deserve this ... 
5 Minute Drive = 20 Minute Walk\ 
1 1/2 Hr . Errands in a car that smells like berries VS . 5 Hr . errands on public transportation with the smelliest people in the surrounding Tacoma areas .... I miss my car soooo bad 
Seriously , I'm like losing all faith in humanity . I'm embarrassed to be of the same species sometimes . So many people are worthless . What is the world coming to ? 
Histrionic ! So that's what they call it ! 
Oughta be seen on the streets in a new ( not literally like a 2011 or anything ) ride by the end of this week . I wonder what it will be ... 
Tomorrow or the day after I'll be behind some new wheels !!!! :) 
Carpe Diem . Before you run out of diem 
Note To Uncle Sam : \I WANT YOU ... To fuck off ! \ " Government is trying to screw me once again ! We don't have enough poverty they wanna be negligent resulting in putting a hardworking american out of his residence by screwing with his income ? FML " 
A very nice and unsuspecting call for a job interview . Went in and LOVED it and the people were great . Ooooh , man . This job could be my salvation ! Decent pay in a PROFESSIONAL office environment 
Great just what I need ... Having a lady who speaks ridiculously broken english to discuss with me and go over my appeal with social security trying to screw me . This isn't gonna go well . 
I'm so lame ( or determined or desperate ) that i've been practicing what I am going to say for this CEO's phone interview tomorrow . I got 3 or 4 other people aiming for this position and I either will or won't have it within a few days . Made a good enough impression the 1st round interview . Gotta do it one more time and be the BEST . The outcome will determine my immediate future : Keep my apartment or out on my ass ? Truly terrified 
FUCK YEAAAAAAAHHHH !!!!! I GOT THE JOB ! I CAN KEEP MY CAR !!! I WON'T LOSE MY APARTMENT !!! LIFE IS GREAAAAT !!!! I was actually told at the interview I'd speak to < PROPFEMALE > and know something within a few days , but she asked me to start by the end of the interview :) 
Gotta love that \25 years old\ " car insurance discount ! " 
I wanna go back to sleep :( but I figure I might as well get back into the routine of waking up early in the morning . New job starts tomorrow . Hello regular hours with weekends off ! 
The last day of work at Safeway was possibly the greatest ever ! Goodbye stinky chinese food and impatient , hungry assholes !!! 
THANKS FOR ALL THE \HAPPY BIRTHDAY\ " s ! \ 
Soooooo tired ... But another 8 hours need to be put in to make some $$$ 
Studies show 80% of communication is non-verbal . Interesting .... Now SHUT UP ! :) 
Gettin ' paid to listen to Pandora and read for a shift is pretty awesome ... Unless you hate reading . I enjoy it :)
