When you sit near a person who is talking in a language you don't understand , you sometimes feel normal or even irritated cause you don't get it . When you know what they are talking about , sometimes you feel like you're eavesdropping ... 
Will anyone please give me some motivation to do my last essay D: 
So it seems ... \normal\ " people don't understand a collector's pride ... OTL " 
Japanese class today was awesome ! I'm still on the waitlist ... and my friend is on the petition list ... We'll go again on Thursday to see how it is . But the class ... was amazing (* A * )\ 
Although the teacher has somewhat of a heavy accent ... \ 
Feels weird to be high school students ... 
I can't believe how stupid I am . I got the ADD code from my professor on TUESDAY . I thought it was just some random set of < PROPFIRST > ... but no ... it's the < PROPFIRST > for me to be registered ( o__o ) So ... I'M IN THE CLASS ! WOOO ! Going to get harder OTL 
Got in Japanese class !!! ( official registered student ) Bought my textbook and workbook ( new ) for $180 OTL THANK YOU , SIS ! I'm going to try my best and learn ! Wish me luck you guys ! 
People ... let me clarify this ... I am NOT a guy ! Dx How come people keep mistaking me as a guy TT^TT \ 
-give glares to < PROPFEMALE > - 
Omgosh ... it has only been the third day and now I need to memorize 60 hiraganas ( @o @ll ) 
Recently , I've been obsessed with SNSD . Has K-POP finally starting to move me away from Anime/Manga ? ... Not ever will that happen ... \ 
( SNSD <3 ) 
For those people who can sleep with music , they never seem to be able to get up when the alarm rings ... 
Emotion of the Day : Sleepy\ 
First Day of School is very tiring and boring because I have classes right after that OTL\ 
Current Status : Dozing off in Japanese Class . 
Getting my first K-Pop CD today ! \ 
I finally saved up enough money for it , wooo ~ \\(*A*)/ 
I got my first K-Pop CD ( and officially my first CD ever ... ) ! Love it lots ~ <3 \ 
Run Devil Run : Girls ' Generation The Second Album Repackage\ 
Along with ... \ 
- Album photobook of Run Devil Run photoshoot . \ 
- Signatures of all the girls . \ 
- A poster of one member . ( I got one of my favorite member , the kid leader TaeYeon ! <3 )\ 
Currently saving up for SNSD's < PROPFEMALE > CD . 
I can't believe I just got ban from SNSD ( TATT ) And all other K-POP related things ... \ 
I wonder ... why didn't that happened to Anime/Manga !? 
It is hard for me not to type SNSD or Soshified on my search bars OTL\ 
Currently \trying\ " to read manga . " 
Going to my Aunt's wedding today ! Congratulation ~ \ 
Best wishes to you both ! \ 
\ 
... As for me ... I really don't want to wear the dress (= A = ll)\ 
Or make up even ! 
Bought my second K-POP ( or SNSD in this case ) CD ! \ 
SNSD ( Girls ' Generation ) Second Album : Oh ! \ 
<3 <3 <3 \ 
Comes along with an small album book with members ' messages and pictures . Also comes with a pocket/wallet picture . \ 
I think I bought it a bit overpriced ... OTL\ 
But whatevers , at least I know it's authentic <3 \ 
Saving up money to buy \Girls ' Generation's New Beginning DVD\ " and \ " Baby Baby CD \"." 
Awkward ~ \ 
I saw my school's Vietnamese teacher at my aunt's wedding ... -cough-\ 
We're somehow connected ...? \ 
And he's not even technichallly my teacher ( o__o ll ) 
Made an online purchase of New Beginning of SNSD DVD ~ \ 
... Waiting for it to arrive 10-13 days later OTL ... \ 
( Also hoping to actually make it home from dental appointment tomorrow for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s good-bye stage , as MCs , on Music Core . ) 
Sometimes I seriously weird-ed out myself ... \ 
Today I woke up wanting to clean and organize stuffs ... badly . ( o__o ) 
Like this if you think I'm way too obsessed ... \ 
[ Thanks < PROPMALE > ( for the second time ) , who fixed my mistake . I blame my grammar problems ... ] 
I succedded ( in some way I don't even know of ) in converting my sister ! \ 
She had put SNSD songs on her iPod ~ 
I owe my sister $50 for buying the SNSD New Beginning DVD . I just found out SNSD Gee Album Limited Pressing only has 9 left in stock . It became $23 with the stupid costly shipping price ... \ 
I pay back exactly $20 , which leave my debt to be at $30 , which could be paid back by exactly the time when the album would be release ... with nothing in stock . \ 
WHAT SHOULD I DO !? BTW , There is no interest nor time limit to my debt . 
I literally cried when I managed to make it in time to succesfully buy SNSD Gee [ Limited Pressing ] Album ... there was exactly one left in stock . \ 
[ Note : Believe it or not but I used Mrs. Hathaway's computer to make the purchase cause I was scared it would run out . Yes ... I'm THAT desperate D < ] 
Direct TV just called me a Mr. .. and prefer to me as Sir over the phone ( o__o ;;) 
YES ! My item is Inbound OUT of Customs ( out of government inspection) ~ \ 
Probably arrive on Monday ~ \ 
Can't wait ! \ 
SNSD <3 \ 
(-coughYulSic-cough ) 
Monique ... this is a message to you even though you don't have a FB ... Asking me if I like < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > more is a bad question for my mind ... \ 
And telling me later that you are going to pair that person up with JaeJoong does not help D < 
I just called home and found out that ... \ 
MY DVD CAME HOME ! \ 
But ... I won't be able to touch it or even look at it until I get out of class ... \ 
5 more hours here I come \\(T^TT\\ ) Wait for me ~ 
Words cannot describe how happy I was when I opened the package to reveal the beautiful , sealed , and clean New Beginning of SNSD DVD ~ \ 
Going to watch it even though I have PSAT tomorrow ! \ 
[[ While I'm waiting for Invincible Youth to load ... OTL ]] 
Instead of making my sister into a S <3 NE ... I somehow made her into a < PROPFEMALE > fan unintentionally D: \ 
[[ Side Note : I seriously want satellite so I can watch Invincible Youth with Eng Sub on TV TT^TT ]] 
As I watch Invincible Youth .... I felt like going back to my gaming days of farming with Harvest < PROPFEMALE > lol ... WHO WANTS TO FREELOAD MY WII AND COME PLAY WITH ME !? \ 
-coughDuyencough- 
My life is full of coincidence and irony ... recently , it also revolves around the letters T and K , and sometimes S and Y ... 
Had a totally stressed out day today . Thanks to Brendato and my sister ( and of course SNSD ) , my stress had been mostly depleted ~ 
Currently trying my best to save money for next week . SNSD Hoot ! Album is being released on Thursday ... I'm getting it on Friday ! \ 
[ Along with a poster hopefully (>__< )]\ 
Please wish me luck hahaha 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and post this as your status . Do it for at least an hour , for those who have died of cancer or who are still fighting .

Should I just go in the class at 7 , turn in my homework , take the quiz , then head home ? \ 
[ I took the crappiest notes today for hw ... OTL ] 
I find it hilarious how SNSD made a 2-day recover from a flu possible . 
Feeling the pain of disappointment ... and being \deceived\ " ... \ 
Got my SNSD's Hoot ! Album !!! Surprisingly , I got the limited edition version that comes with stickers and a member card ... without even knowing it ( o__o ll)\ 
Strangely ... I seemed to always get TaeYeon related extras ... First it was the poster and now it's the member card . Awesomness ~ 
Got myself SNSD's Hoot ! Poster !... for a very good deal b( ^__^ )\ 
Surprisingly , my mom is letting me < PROPFEMALE > it up once I get my metal frame for the poster ( o__o ll ) I am so glad I have a supportive parent and sister of my interests ~ 
Got my braces ~ So far , no pain . \ 
Somewhat more importantly , I finally bought the poster frame for my SNSD's Hoot ! Poster after some hardships D < \ 
Going to < PROPFEMALE > it up hopefully tomorrow ~ Hoot Hoot ! \ 
[[ What do you guys recommend I eat since I have braces now ? ]] 
Finally hanged my SNSD Hoot ! Poster ! My mom is awesome ~ \

Congratulation SNSD for winning the Gold Disk Award !!! \ 
\\(>///<)/ 
I should seriously be studying right now ... My final is in less than 2 hours . 
Sis you shouldn't have wrapped my gift so early and now all I could do is stare at it while it's tempting me ... You shouldn't also have put that present on my SNSD corner (= __ = ll)\ 
Thank you my lovely sister ! Saranghaeyo Daisuki desu ~ <3 
Lol I find it funny how Music Town had to re-ordered all of their SNSD Albums cause I was the one who bought it all lol ... I was also the first one to bought the < PROPFEMALE > Card 2.5 Set (>__< ) Lol 
My sister is offering the deal \do-my-homework-and-get-a-prize-immediately\ " deal again ~ \ 
I'm getting the suspicion the my sister bought me the SNSD Wall Calendar when it's not even on my wishlist (<__< ) ... That would be awesome ! ( Cause I'm secretly buying the desktop one fufufufu ) 
I realize how difficult Japanese was after taking it ... the only thing I can do is speak , sounding fluent and all , but with completely wrong order (= __ = )\ 
My Sister : \SEE ?! I TOLD YOU ! Take Korean now (^__^) v \"" 
My sister created an improvised version of SNSD's Hoot , with much more complex moves ( o__o ll )

I've been losing internet for more than 5 hours ... found out I just needed to restart the system (= __ = ) 
So uh ... I just got a confirmation from SoshiGoods that my item has been shipped through Air Parcel shipping but ... the tracking number is for EMS ( O__O )\ 
Air Parcel - Takes a week ... cheaper ... \ 
EMS - Takes 2-4 days ... heck more expensive . 
Should I take a picture of my full collection after Christmas ? Cause some of you said you wanted to see it ( o__o ) When I say ' full ' I mean every corner there is ... 
My sister gave me a new nickname : Genie . \ 
So now I'm going around saying \sowoneul malhaebwa\ " (= __ = ) " 
A conversation between me and < PROPFEMALE > Tran ... \ 
Me : Hey < PROPFEMALE > , you are such an .... finish the sentence for me . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : \ 
I\ 
D\ 
-a moment of silence-\

Currently converting my mom ( and somehow my aunt ) into being a S <3 NE ~ So by coincidence , while I was checking out my < PROPFEMALE > Album I got yesterday , my mom sat there and watch the whole MV lol ... 
Watching K-Pop X-Mas Concert on MBCD ( TV) ~ Go T-ara ! \ 
Where is SNSD D:

Calming my disappointment of Soshified's quote ... \Sorry guys 
I want to frame all my posters even to the little ones (= A+ )\ 
I feel like my collection is missing something ... 
Sometimes I feel like SNSD ' stalks ' me ... \ 
I was buying some snacks at a bakery store and all of the sudden , the moment I stepped in , I heard ... \Somewhere over the rainbow ... \ " It was TaeYeon's voice ... \ 
Bought my first non-SNSD K-POP Album ! \ 
Was barganing between SHINee Hello or T-ARA Vol . 2 Temptastic , and bought T-ARA's instead , cause it's more expensive ... and my sister paid : D\ 
Just saying but MNet really know how to make their album flashy . SM all the way though ~ 
Thanks late start ~ Because of you , I get to watch Dream High with my sister . She's giving nicknames to the casts like she always does ( o__o ) 
Such a weird weather ... \

My life is so ... ah God ... help me . \ 
I ordered SNSD Photobook on Feb 8 online but I was unsure if it even ship yet , so I bought it for cheaper at Music Town . Today the seller online sent me a message saying he already shipped it and it should be here soon . \ 
The phobio ? \ 
Now I have to pay for the shipping fee to ship it back to him . \ 
Unless someone wants to buy it from me ... ANYONE ?! 
My SNSD : Girls in Phuket Photobook arrived \\(T^TT \\) \ 
4-7 Days earlier than expected ( o__o )\ 
I finished my homework three times faster xD\

So much stress today and I seriously want to cry on the spot but for the sakes of others I'll stay strong ( > A < ) ! 
I can't take a shower until these random dudes come in my house with their own set of keys and input a heater D < \ 
It's freaking 7:30 so hurry up !!! 
Kwon < PROPFEMALE > invaded my facebook ... Not that I mind <3 
Is anyone here willing to give me piano lessons 8D 
I have a tissue box in my living room . Not because I am so OCD that I need one practically everywhere ... but ... \ 
It is quite useful when you are watching Korean Dramas . 
So ... when you have the same birthday as a celebrity ... it sure feels different . \ 
I have the same birthday as SeoHyun's husband , < PROPFEMALE > Yonghwa (= __ = ll ) 
Started AP Euro Chapter 24 Study Guide . My close buddies , if you need the study guide , I'll be willing to send it to you with information filled xD 
I seriously hate it when I get distracted by a laughing Spongebob next door with the kid watching to freaking loud TV D < 
Congratulations my fellow Gghs Japaneseclub for passing the audition ! \ 
Mandatory rehearsal on Friday at the < PROPMALE > Wash . Everyone in the performance must attend ! 
Attended a Christian group hang-out with International Students and felt like I learned more about God . Is VERY happy ;D 
My sickness that had prolonged for 8 weeks had acted up once again . How wonderful ... \ 
I hope I will recover fully by the 9th week ... 
Can someone help be contact < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !? She won't pick up her home phone D:

SMEnt is making a Korean Version of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !!! PLEASE CAST SNSD <3 OTL\ 
Rumor : There will be a twist and instead of an all boys-school , it would be an all-girls school ... ( oAO ;) 
Sometimes I wonder about how my senior year would be like and I enjoy the false imaginations . \ 
When I think about < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s future ... my head starts hurting . 
On March 19 , 2011 the < PROPFEMALE > will be closest to the earth . So within about the next two weeks , there’s going to be a lot of natural disasters . No matter where you live in the world right now , just be prepared . Pray to God and He'll answer you . 
To : < PROPFEMALE > Ho OMGOSH I just noticed how < PROPMALE > looks a LOT like Key D: \ 
I see what you did thar ... 
Mom : \Sometimes I think you're better than your sister . You're like the man in the house . You're my son ;D \ " \ 
Does anyone have Mr. Frank !? I left my health book in his class OTL

\But once again 
That awkward moment when someone posted your photoshop work ( w/credit ) on tumblr and it got popular .... ( o__o ) And when you , the creator , post it up ... no one reblog ... OTL 
Came up with wondeful ideas for the ' testing period ' of elections ... fufufu 
Sleep > Kagan 
Eating homemade jajamyeon ( > A < ) Too good <3 
I completely forgot I have late start so I'm stressing out about not having enough time ... ( .__. ) ... This is what happened to your brain after a nap . 
I woke up this morning with a line from a song I heard before REPLAYING OVER AND OVER IN MY HEAD D: Sad thing is I don't recognize the song . Another sad thing is ... it's from a guy perspective . \ 
\But I can't stop thinking about you girl ~\" \ 
Hate it when I want to eat but can't lift myself off the computer . Is now chewing on food at 9:30 PM ... 
Just bought Barron's AP European History Test Preparation Book ... (= A = ) My $30 bucks ... Now time to ' tackle the AP exam'! 
I feel so immature ... 
Looking back at old pictures make me miss the past . \ 
Looking at my older friends make me wonder about the future . \ 
Looking at myself make me want to stick to the present . 
Planned out my schedule for AP Exam studies ... Realized I seriously have no time to spare ( o__o ) 
After 5 hours of studying and excercising , here comes the ultimate break ! 
I need a kick , slap , splash of water , or practically anything that is not too harmful to wake me up right now . 
In the moment of unboxing MBLAQ's album . \ 
Mom : \Why do you keep swicthing groups ? \ " \
